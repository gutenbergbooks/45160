<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> object of this volume is to form a manual for the
use chiefly of those who, not being possessed of a voluminous
annotated edition, are fain to content themselves
with the simple text. But even those who have a perfect
Shakespeare library cannot well dispense with it;
for my original corrections, which are very numerous,
are nowhere else to be found.</p>

<p>It was originally intended to form the complement to
my Edition of the Plays, and as such I had announced
its immediate appearance. Why it did not appear has
been explained in Notes and Queries (3 S. vii. 175), and
the statement there made was incontrovertible; for it
was the simple truth. The delay, however, has been
no injury, but rather a benefit to it. Its relation to the
Edition now is that, while it is perfectly independent and
suited to any edition, the Edition without it is somewhat
like what a Euclid would be without diagrams or
demonstrations, as the reader will meet with numerous
alterations of the text, and be quite ignorant of how or
why they were made. Moreover the errors and oversights
which escaped me in it will be found here all
corrected.</p>

<p>To my own Edition I regard it, then, as indispensable;
and if I were to mention any other to which it is peculiarly
adapted, I should say that which is named the
Globe; for it contains a copious and excellent Glossary&mdash;that
in mine, which is not by me, is scanty&mdash;which,
with the Notes and <a href="#Page_385">Index</a> of this volume, will leave
little unexplained.</p>

<p>It is certainly very disheartening to those who devote
their time and labour to the elucidation of our Classic
authors to find how small the number is of those readers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
who are at all anxious to understand them perfectly.
The great majority, in fact, are quite satisfied if they
can get at the general meaning of a difficult or obscure
passage, and so glide over it. Still I am not without
hope that among the tens of thousands who buy, and I
presume read, these Plays, there may be found a few, a
very few, hundreds who may wish to understand what
they read, and will therefore possess themselves of this
volume. Profit is not dreamed of, but it is hoped that
loss may not be incurred.</p>

<p>When I was preparing my Edition of Milton's Poems,
I fell into the habit of correcting the text of our old
writers. Hence I have corrected copies of Chaucer,
Spenser, the dramatists and others, which mayhap may
prove useful to future editors. The corrections of
Shakespeare proved so numerous as to form the present
volume; but the idea of editing his works never
entered my mind till it was proposed to me, when I fear
my vanity became interested. I had been confessedly
the best editor of Milton, I might perchance stand in
the same relation to Shakespeare. My wish had been
to be to the Faerie Queen what I had been to Paradise
Lost; and I may yet, perhaps, communicate some remarks
on it in the pages of Notes and Queries.</p>

<p>It was on the first edition of Collier's Shakespeare
that I made my corrections, and of previous emendations,
if not noticed there, I knew nothing. I afterwards read
the Variorum and later editions; hence I shall often be
found saying that I had been anticipated. This was
always a source of pleasure to me, as a proof of the
correctness of my emendation. Porson, we are told,
actually shed tears of joy when on meeting with a copy
of Aristophanes with MS. notes by Bentley, he found
his corrections had so frequently been anticipated. His
delight was still greater when on the discovery of the
Ravenna MS. he saw so many of his readings confirmed.</p>

<p>I must confess that experience has given me a good
deal of confidence in my own critical powers, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>
apt to fancy that when I cannot conquer a difficulty it
is nearly insuperable. Hence I have been little anxious
about learning what has been written by late critics.</p>

<p>At the risk, or rather I should say with the certainty,
of being charged with egotism, I will here state the
following fact; for why should truth be concealed? As
I was one day, many years ago, discussing some points
in my 'Tales and Popular Fictions' with the late Mr.
Douce, he suddenly exclaimed "Oh, that you had but
<em>my</em> knowledge! What discoveries you <em>would</em> make!" I
believe he was right, and that, under more favourable
circumstances, I should have done much; but it was
not to be.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to grapple with every difficulty,
to leave, if possible, no knot unloosed. Some of my
corrections must (many, I think, probably will) be admitted
into the text. At the same time, I freely confess
that some of these emendations are merely desperate
remedies for desperate diseases; and it may be that
future critics may have more success than I have had.
I have, I believe, advanced the criticism of Shakespeare
some stages; and if succeeding critics follow the path I
have traced, the Plays will perhaps be, ere long, brought
as near their original state as is possible.</p>

<p>I regard the Introduction to the Notes as the most
valuable part of this volume, as I have there endeavoured
to reduce emendatory criticism to rule and law.
I would earnestly recommend the reader to make himself
master of it before using the Notes. It would also
perhaps be well to do the same with the Index. The
chief object of the Life, I may add, is to remove suspicion
respecting the poet's private character.</p>

<p>The portions of the text given in the Notes are
always that of the original editions, unless when it is
otherwise expressed. I have made them as brief as
possible, as this book will, of course, only be read in
conjunction with the Plays themselves. I have only
occasionally given the metrical arrangement; those
who would enjoy the pleasure of reading the Plays in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
perfect metric order must read them in my Edition.
Finally, in very obvious corrections I have not deemed
it necessary to state that I had been anticipated.</p>

<p>This is the last of my works; my literary life here
terminates. I am fast approaching the utmost limit
set to human life by the Psalmist, my powers are necessarily
on the decline, and prudence counsels obedience
to the precept:</p>

<h2><a id="LIFE_OF_SHAKESPEARE"></a>LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE.</h2>

<p>A <small>FAMILY</small> of the name of Shakespeare&mdash;pronounced, it
would seem, Sh&#462;ksp&#283;r&mdash;was numerous in Warwickshire
during the middle ages. About the middle of the sixteenth
century John, the son of Richard Shakespeare,
a farmer residing at Snitterfield in that county, was settled
at Stratford-on-Avon, and was&mdash;though it appears
he could neither read nor write&mdash;a leading member of
the Corporation. Various accounts are given of his
trade and occupation. We have proof that in 1556 he
was a glover; he was afterwards a farmer or yeoman;
Aubrey says he was a butcher; and according to Rowe,
he was "a considerable dealer in wool." He would
seem in fact to have been one who was ready to turn
to any honest occupation by which money might be
made.</p>

<p>In 1557 John Shakespeare married Mary, the youngest
daughter of Robert Arden of Wilmecote, a man of
good landed property, and belonging to a family of no
mean note in the county of Warwick. By her he had
either eight or ten children, of whom we need only notice
William, the third, who was baptized April 26th,
1564; but the exact date of his birth is unknown. As
his father was a member of the Corporation, it is highly
probable that, as Rowe asserts, he was sent to the Free
School of the town. How long he continued at it, and
what he learned there, are matters on which we have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
certain information. He had probably an ordinary
English education, and he certainly, as his writings
show, had learned some Latin; but he does not seem to
have got beyond the elementary books, and of Greek, if
it was taught in the school, he learned nothing whatever.
We are told by one authority that he acted as an
assistant in the school; by another that his father took
him away early to assist in his own business of wool-stapling
or, as the former, namely Aubrey, says, of
butchering, who adds that "when he killed a calf he
would do it in a high style, and make a speech,"&mdash;of
course a mere figment. Malone conjectures&mdash;and in my
opinion not without a show of probability&mdash;from the
frequent occurrence of law-terms in his dramas, and his
correct appreciation of their meaning, that he may have
been for some time in the office of an attorney in Stratford.
This, however, is all uncertainty; but at all
events, judging from the turn of his mind, I should be
inclined to say that, beside his accurate observation of
men and manners, he read all the books he could obtain
in his native town.</p>

<p>In the registry of the diocese of Worcester is preserved
a document bearing date November 28, 1582,
securing the Bishop against injury in the case of his
licensing certain persons to be married with once asking
of the banns. These persons are William Shakespeare,
then in his nineteenth year, and Anne Hathaway, then
apparently aged twenty-six years; for she died in 1623
at the age of sixty-seven years: she was therefore about
eight years her husband's senior. When their marriage
was celebrated we are unable to learn; but the baptism
of Susanna, their first child, took place on the 26th of
May, 1583, just six months after the date of the document
quoted above. The natural inference is obvious.
Shakespeare, like Burns, knew his wife before the law
had made her his; and, like him, he acted honourably
towards her.</p>

<p>This, perhaps the only imprudent act of Shakespeare's
life, has been variously judged. Nothing, we know, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
more common than for young men to fall in love with
women older than themselves; and among the class of
society to which both parties belonged, instances were,
and are, not uncommon of the rules of prudence being
transgressed in moments of weakness, while the moral
principle remains untainted. We know that Burns's
"Bonnie Jean" proved a most exemplary wife; and one of
the most truly virtuous and unaffectedly modest women
I ever knew was one who had acted thus imprudently.
The bride of the future poet was Anne, daughter of
Richard Hathaway, a husbandman, or substantial yeoman,
of Shottery, a hamlet about a mile from Stratford,
an intimate friend, it would appear, of John Shakespeare's;
and hence we may presume that an intimacy
prevailed also between the two families, and the not unlikely
result was what has been stated.</p>

<p>We now have Shakespeare, at the commencement of
his twentieth year, a married man, and the father of
a child. On the 2nd of February, 1584-85, before he
had completed his twenty-first year, were baptized Hamnet
and Judith, twins. We hear of no more children
of William and Anne Shakespeare; and soon after&mdash;most
probably in 1586&mdash;Shakespeare left Stratford, and set
out to seek his fortune in the metropolis. According to
Rowe, he fled to escape from the persecution of Sir
Thomas Lucy, of Charlecote-park, near Stratford, from
whose park he and some other young men had stolen
deer&mdash;a not unusual, and not very discreditable practice
in those days. The knight, we are told, was indignant
and vindictive, and the transgressor took his revenge by
writing and affixing to the gate of Charlecote-park a
satirical ballad, of which the first stanza has been preserved,
and which, if genuine, is mere doggrel and
utterly unworthy of Shakespeare. He may, however,
have so written it on purpose. This is said to have
added oil to the fire of the knight's rage, and to escape
from it the author fled to London. His biographers in
general are of opinion that his resentment against his
persecutor did not die out, and that after his death and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the lapse of many years he ridiculed him in the character
of Justice Shallow in The Merry Wives of Windsor.
But this was little in the character of "gentle" Shakespeare;
and the whole theory is refuted by the fact that
the allusion to "the dozen white <em>luces</em>" in the Justice's
coat-armour, on which it is founded, does not occur in
the original form of that play. It may have been made
afterwards by way of joke, and without any malignity.</p>

<p>There is certainly no inherent improbability in this
narrative; and it may have had its effect in determining
Shakespeare to quit Stratford. But that it should have
been the sole cause of his doing so is what I am disposed
to question. We must recollect that Shakespeare
was a man endowed with genius of the very highest
order, and that he must have aspired to a wider field for
its exercise than his native town could afford, that he
had a family, and that his circumstances were very
slender, while those of his father, as we have sufficient
evidence, had been greatly reduced. Nor does it appear
that he&mdash;who, as has been already observed, except in
the case of his marriage, was always prudent&mdash;set out
for London without having a definite object in view.</p>

<p>Now various companies of players, as we learn, were
in the habit of visiting Stratford, like other country
towns, and performing there in the Guildhall. It can
be hardly doubted that Shakespeare, in whom dramatic
genius was inborn, must have been excited by
these performances, however low the merit of the pieces&mdash;perhaps
even have felt that he was capable of producing
something superior to them of the same kind. He probably
then made the acquaintance of the players, one of
whom, Burbage, was, it is supposed, a native of the
town, and some others, natives of the county, and
proposed embracing their profession. He was young,
handsome, of animated and even brilliant conversation.
There can be little doubt, then, that he met with encouragement,
and was readily received among them.
This was, it is most likely, in the year 1586, when he
was two-and-twenty. Rowe says "he was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
into the company at first in a very mean rank;" and in
1693 the parish-clerk of Stratford, a man eighty years
of age, told a person named Dowdall, that he "was received
into the playhouse as a serviture." Of course,
like almost every other actor, he began at the bottom,
having as it were to serve his apprenticeship. This,
then, seems to be all true enough; not so another tradition,
related by Johnson as coming from Pope and
Rowe, namely, that his first occupation in London was
holding gentlemen's horses at the door of the playhouse,
in which business he succeeded so well that he hired
boys to act under him. How little like Shakespeare
this is need hardly be said.</p>

<p>A question which cannot be answered very satisfactorily
is, What did Shakespeare at this time do with his
wife and children? The probability would seem to be,
that he left them at Stratford, and, as is most likely, at
his father's, till he should see what success he was
likely to meet with in London.</p>

<p>It would seem that for the first few years he was
merely an actor; and if the Ellesmere Papers, published
by Mr. Collier, be genuine, he had in 1589
become a sharer in the Blackfriars Theatre. Before
this date he may have begun to try his hand at making
additions and alterations in the plays of others. Of
these we seem to have examples in the Second and
Third Parts of King Henry VI.; and there is a manifest
allusion to this practice of his in the following passage
of Green's Groat's Worth of Wit, bought with a
Million of Repentance, published after his death in
1592. Green is addressing his fellow dramatists Marlow,
Peele, and others; and he says, "There is an upstart
crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his <em>Tygre's
heart wrapt in a player's hyde</em>, supposes he is as well
able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you;
and, being an absolute Johannes Factotum, is in his own
conceit the only <em>Shake-scene</em> in a country." Here the
allusion to Shakespeare's name is quite plain, and the
line in italics is a parody on one in one of the plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
which he appears to have thus treated. As this allusion
seems to have caused just offence, Chettle, who had
given Green's work to the world, took occasion shortly
after in a work of his own, his Kind-hart's Dream,
to make an apology, in which he says of Shakespeare,
"Myself have seen his demeanour, no less civil than
he excellent in the quality he professes. Besides, divers
of worship have reported his uprightness of dealing,
which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in
writing that approves his art." We thus see that
Shakespeare was regarded as an excellent player (for
<em>quality</em> then answered to <em>profession</em> at the present time),
as an elegant writer (<em>facetious</em> being employed in its
classic sense), and as an upright and honourable man,
and further, perhaps, as moving in what we should term
good society.</p>

<p>Moreover this work of Chettle's, published at the end
of 1592 or beginning of 1593, furnishes what I regard
as a proof that Shakespeare had not at that time brought
an original piece on the stage; for speaking of Green he
says, "He was of singular pleasance, the very supporter,
and&mdash;to no man's disgrace be this intended&mdash;<em>the only
comedian of a vulgar writer in this country</em>;" of which
last words the plain meaning is, that Green had as yet
been the only tolerable writer of English comedy. Now
we have sufficient means for judging of Green's comic
powers; and surely no man in his senses would have
ventured to write these words, had he been ever so prejudiced,
if Shakespeare had already produced the Comedy
of Errors or The Two Gentlemen of Verona. We may
therefore venture to assert that neither of these plays
was acted earlier than 1593.</p>

<p>We may here, by the way, notice some curious coincidences
between Shakespeare and the great comic poet
of France, Molière. There is some reason to suppose
that both of them were originally connected with the
law; they both went on the stage at, we may say, the
age of twenty, or a little later. Shakespeare was in his
thirtieth year when he produced his first original play,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Molière in his thirty-second when he wrote L'Etourdi;
but he had previously given some short pieces. Finally,
the former died at the close, the latter at the commencement
of his fifty-second year.</p>

<p>The allusion to the poet's literary character in Kindhart's
Dream was in all probability to his Venus and
Adonis, which was published in 1593, but which may,
as was the custom in those days, have previously circulated
in manuscript among his "private friends;" or
it may have been to his Sonnets, which, as we shall presently
see, thus circulated at this time. It is impossible
to say when this poem was written; but there certainly
is no necessity for supposing, with Mr. Collier, that it
was composed at Stratford. Shakespeare's mind easily
retained the requisite rural imagery; and with his power
of rapid composition and command of language, a very
few weeks would suffice at any time for its production.
This poem, which he terms his "unpolished lines," and
"the first heir of my invention," was dedicated to Henry
Wriothesly, Earl of Southampton. It met with general
applause, and was followed, in 1594, by Lucrece, also
dedicated to the same accomplished nobleman. The dedication,
commencing with "The love I dedicate to your
lordship is without end," would seem to intimate some
degree of friendship on both sides; and as Shakespeare's
private character, as we have seen, appears to have been
most respectable, and Southampton was a well-known
admirer of the drama, some kind of intimacy between
him and the poet is not by any means improbable. There
is also nothing incredible in what Rowe says had been
"handed down by Sir William Davenant," of Lord
Southampton's having "at one time given him £1000
to enable him to go through with a purchase which he
heard he had a mind to." But the amount must be
much exaggerated; for none of Shakespeare's purchases
that we hear of ever came to so large a sum. Mr.
Collier thinks, with some probability, that, as it appears
that the Globe Theatre on the Bankside was built in
1594 by the company to which Shakespeare belonged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Lord Southampton may have given him as much money
as his share of the cost came to, which could not well
have been more than a few hundred pounds.</p>

<p>It was probably also about this time that he wrote his
very enigmatic Sonnets, which Meres, in 1598, calls "his
sugred sonnets among his private friends," meaning perhaps
which only circulated privately in manuscript. I
assign them this early date because their style and language
so strongly resemble those of his two poems and
his early plays, such as Love's Labour's Lost. They
were not published till 1609, and then not by the author
himself. They seem to have been collected from those
who had the manuscripts by a Mr. W. H., whom therefore
the publisher in his dedication terms "the only
begetter" of them, "begetter" in the language of the
time being getter, collector, &amp;c. It has been conjectured,
with great probability, that many of them were written
in the person of Lord Southampton for the lady with
whom he was enamoured; and others may have been
written for other persons, a usual custom then of the
poets of France and England. I feel almost convinced
that few or none of them were written in the poet's own
person. Thus in 1598 he was only thirty-four years
old, and yet some of them are in the character of a man
grey and advanced in years; even in 1609 he was only
forty-five.</p>

<p>Along with the Sonnets was published a poem named
A Lover's Complaint, of the genuineness of which I am
rather dubious. There had already appeared, in 1599,
under the name of Shakespeare, a catchpenny collection
called The Passionate Pilgrim, in which are two of
his manuscript sonnets, and three of those published the
preceding year in Love's Labour's Lost, all of them
with an altered text.</p>

<p>An account of the dates, &amp;c., of Shakespeare's plays
will follow this Life. Here, therefore, it need only be
remarked that they extended over a space of less than
twenty years (from 1592 to 1610?), during which time
he had an active share in the management of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
theatres, and was also an actor for the whole or the
greater part of it. He was, as we may well suppose,
with Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher, and others, a member
of the club instituted by Sir Walter Raleigh, and which
met at the Mermaid Tavern in Bread Street, in which
street, it may be observed by the way, Milton was born
during this period. Fuller has left us some account of
the wit-combats that used to take place at the Mermaid
between our poet and Ben Jonson.</p>

<p>The relations between Shakespeare and his family
during this time are in a state of ambiguity, which no
conjecture can fully clear up. There is not the slightest
ground for supposing that he ever was on ill terms with
his wife; and surely we have no right to suppose that, like
La Fontaine, he left her in the country while he himself
lived in the metropolis; for Shakespeare was a householder,
while La Fontaine lived usually in the <em>hôtels</em> of
his patrons. The more natural supposition is that he
would have removed his wife and children to London as
soon as he had got a firm footing there. Certainly no
entry of the birth of any child of his is to be found in
the register of any London parish; but may not some
physical change, with which we are unacquainted, have
caused his wife to cease from childbearing after the birth
of the twins? There is also no entry of this kind in the
register of Stratford; and yet it can hardly be that he,
any more than La Fontaine, abstained from the bed of
his wife in the annual visits which, according to Aubrey's
very probable account, he was in the habit of making to
his native town. But the burial of his son Hamnet took
place in Stratford on the 11th of August, 1596, whence it
might appear that the family was living there at that
time. To this, however, it may be replied that the family,
though usually resident in London, may have been down
at Stratford when Hamnet took ill, or that he may have
taken ill in London and have been ordered by the physicians
to try the effect of his native air, or that, finally,
he may have died in London, and his body have been
taken down to Stratford for interment with his family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
an act quite in character with Shakespeare. The mist,
therefore, remains so far undispelled. But we are also
to remember that Shakespeare, as above stated, was a
householder in London, which might seem to intimate
that he had a family there. It is to me a matter of extreme
difficulty to believe that he who created so many
of the loveliest female characters that the world has ever
witnessed, should have led, as, we may say, he otherwise
must have done, an irregular life with regard to the
sex; for the effect of such conduct is almost always a
degrading view of female nature; and how pure on
this subject his ideas must always have been is strongly
indicated by the circumstance that three of his most
lovely female characters&mdash;Perdita, Miranda, Imogen&mdash;occur
in the very last plays he wrote. We may here
note the difference between him and La Fontaine. On the
whole, then, my opinion is that Shakespeare had his wife
and children with him in London, and that his life there
was as regular and domestic as his profession permitted.</p>

<p>It has been argued, from a passage in Twelfth Night,
in which a man is advised always to marry a woman
younger than himself, that Shakespeare had felt the
evil consequences of the opposite course. But surely
we should not press thus closely language resulting from
the situation of a character in a drama. And if Shakespeare
was so convinced of the ill consequences of such
a procedure, how came it that only a few months
before his death he gave an apparently cheerful consent
to the marriage of his daughter Judith with Thomas
Quiney, who was four years her junior? This objection,
then, also may be dismissed, and we remain as uncertain
as ever.</p>

<p>We may also venture to deal in a similar way with a
passage in the Tempest (iv. 1.), condemnatory of the
conduct which he and his wife had pursued before their
marriage. Further, as the only mention of his wife in
his will is an interlineation, bequeathing her his "second
best bed, with the furniture," a want of due regard for
her comfort and independence has been inferred. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
this in reality is rather indicative of affection; for, as
Mr. Knight was the first to observe, as his property was
mostly freehold, the law provided for her by assigning
her what it terms dower. Lastly, the desire which Mrs.
Shakespeare is said to have expressed to be buried with
her husband is surely some proof of mutual affection.</p>

<p>It would also seem to be a matter of which there
can be little doubt, that Shakespeare must have been
an indefatigable reader during the first years of his residence
in London. It is strange how none of the commentators
appear to have been aware of this fact; for
it is the only way of accounting for the remarkable
copiousness of his vocabulary. Max Müller, following
Professor Marsh, in his Lectures on the Science of
Language, having observed, on the authority of a
country clergyman, that some of our peasantry have not
more than 300 words in their vocabulary, proceeds as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A well-educated person in England, who has been
at a public school and at the university, who reads his
Bible, his Shakespeare, the Times, and all the books of
Mudie's Library, seldom uses more than about 3000 or
4000 words in actual conversation. Accurate thinkers
and close reasoners, who avoid vague and general expressions,
and wait till they find the word that exactly
fits their meaning, employ a larger stock; and eloquent
speakers may rise to a command of 10,000. Shakespeare,
who displayed a greater variety of expression
than probably any writer in any language, produced all
his plays with about 15,000 words; Milton's works are
built up with about 8000; and the Old Testament says
all that it has to say with 5642 words."</p>

<p>Now how else but by reading could Shakespeare have
got such a store of words? It could not be by conversation,
and he surely did not invent more than a
few of them. This also tends to prove that Venus and
Adonis was not written at Stratford; for his rural vocabulary
could hardly have sufficed for such a poem.</p>

<p>But further, I think I am justified in asserting that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
during the earlier years of his dramatic career Shakespeare
acquired a competent knowledge of the French
and Italian languages. As we shall see, some of his
plays were founded on Italian tales and plays of which
no translation has ever been discovered; and the natural
inference then is, that he had read them in the original.
As to the French, he must have been able to write as
well as read it. As a proof, in his Henry V. there are
scenes of mingled French and English, which scenes are,
like all the prose scenes in our old dramatists, in what
I have denominated <em>metric prose</em>; and this could only be
caused by the whole scene having been the production
of the one mind. The French, too, is incorrect, as it
is also in the really prose French scene between Katherine
and Alice. It seems therefore probable in the
highest degree that Shakespeare was able to write French.
In like manner Ben Jonson has shown in his Alchemist
and elsewhere, that he was able to write Spanish and
other languages.</p>

<p>Another curious question is, Was Shakespeare ever
out of England? This, too, cannot be determined; but
it is clear to me, from various passages of his plays, that
he must have been familiar with the sea-shore; and,
from his correct use of nautical terms, we might suspect
that he had been at sea on board a ship once, if not oftener.
I cannot see any equal proof of his having been familiar
with mountain scenery; and from the comparative
vagueness of his language respecting mountains in
Cymbeline and elsewhere, I rather suspect that he had
never gazed on a mountain-range.</p>

<p>In 1597, the year after he had lost his only son,
Shakespeare began to carry into effect his long-cherished
project of acquiring property in his native county. For
the seemingly trifling sum of £60 he purchased from
William Underhill one of the best houses in the town
of Stratford, named New Place, built by Sir Hugh Clopton
in the reign of Henry VII., consisting of one messuage,
two barns, and two gardens, with their appurtenances.
It was situated in Chapel-street Ward; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
as, in a note taken of corn and malt during a dearth in
the beginning of the following year, we find him set
down as the holder of ten quarters, it would appear that
his family, if not he himself, must have been residing
at that time in this place.</p>

<p>For some years subsequent to this date we find a few
notices of purchases &amp;c. in which Shakespeare was
engaged, but nothing that throws any light on his
personal history. Neither can we ascertain at what
time it was that he disposed of his theatric property;
for that he did so is plain, as he says nothing of it in
his will. It would seem, however, to have been subsequent
to 1610. It would also appear that he lived
in Stratford in very handsome style, probably exercising
a generous hospitality; for we learn from the diary of
the Rev. J. Ward, vicar of that town in 1662, that he
had <em>heard</em> that Shakespeare "spent at the rate of £1000
a-year." This sum, however, though not by any means
so large, relative to the present value of money, as is
usually supposed, is utterly incredible; but still it
proves the tradition of his housekeeping having been
liberal.</p>

<p>On the 5th of June, 1607, Shakespeare's eldest daughter,
Susanna, was married to Dr. John Hall, a physician of
some eminence, settled in Stratford. They had but one
child, a daughter named Elizabeth, who was married
first to Thomas Nash, and secondly to John (afterwards
Sir John) Barnard, of Abington, in Northamptonshire.
She died in 1649, having had no children by either
husband; and with her ended the lineal descent from
the great Shakespeare; for Judith, his other daughter,
who married a couple of months before his death, though
she had three sons, outlived them all, as none of them
attained to the age of twenty years. Poetic genius seems
fated never to found a family; it is above the vulgar
distinctions of human life.</p>

<p>We know not the exact date of Shakespeare's final
departure from London and settlement at Stratford;
but it probably was not much later than the year 1610.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
His life after his retirement was not destined to be very
long. We may picture him to ourselves as passing his
days in tranquil enjoyment, interesting himself somewhat
in the affairs of the borough, conversing with his
neighbours, telling anecdotes of his life in London, reading
his Bible and Chaucer, Spenser, and other poets, and
no doubt his North's Plutarch, giving occasional play
to his wit, in short, leading the life of a wise and sensible
man, contented with the condition he had made
his mature choice of as most productive of happiness.</p>

<p>It is probable that in his fifty-second year he felt a
decline in his constitution which reminded him of the
uncertainty of life; for on the 25th of January, 1615-16,
he made his Will, which was executed exactly two
months later; and on the 23rd of the following April
he breathed his last. He was buried in the church of
Stratford, where his grave and monument may still be
seen. The disease of which he died is unknown. The
vicar, Mr. Ward, already referred to, says, "Shakespeare,
Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting, and,
it seems, drank too hard; for Shakespeare died of a fever
there contracted." This no doubt is not impossible, but
it is not very probable. If we may judge from passages
in his plays, Shakespeare was an enemy to deep
drinking; and it is hardly likely that he should, so late
in life too, have committed such excess (worthy only of
a Burns) as is here supposed, even in the company of
Ben Jonson, a visit from whom to Stratford, if he had
made it, would with its consequences in all probability
have formed part of his communications to Drummond
two years later. We may then, I think, safely venture
to reject this account of Shakespeare's death, and
acknowledge that its cause is utterly unknown, and will
probably always remain unknown.</p>

<p>It would appear from Shakespeare's Will that he had
at the time of his death but very little money; for, excepting
a few trifling legacies, the only sum mentioned
is £300 which he left to his younger daughter Judith,
making apparently a very unequal division of his property;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
for to his elder daughter Susanna he left all his
lands, tenements, etc., in Stratford and elsewhere, the
value of which must have been very far beyond that
of the sum devised to Judith. In fact we might suppose
that the property enumerated in a general way in
his Will had cost more, and were of greater value than
would seem to be indicated.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that the cause of this unequal
division was displeasure at Judith's marriage; but, beside
that we have no proof of any such feeling towards
her, the real cause lies evidently far deeper. It was
his passionate desire to be the founder of a family in
his native county. This it was that animated all his
theatric exertions, and he regarded the wonderful creations
of his genius merely as means to this one great
end. We might have presumed that the death of his
only son in 1596 would have given a check to this passion;
but, on the contrary, it was, as we have seen, in the
very next year that he commenced purchasing property
in Warwickshire; and we also find that in that year, or
more certainly in 1599, a grant of arms was made to
John Shakespeare by the Heralds' College, in which he
was authorized to impale the bearings of the Ardens,
his wife's family, with his own; and the probability
would seem to be, that previously the Shakespeare family
had had no coat of arms. By a statute, however, of the
later Plantagenets every freeholder was to have his proper
<em>seal</em> of arms; and that of the Shakespeares may
have been the eagle and spear, whence the Heralds
easily formed the coat of arms used by Shakespeare.
In obtaining this, John Shakespeare must have acted
under the influence and at the expense of his son William.</p>

<p>In his Will, Shakespeare leaves his lands, tenements,
&amp;c. to his daughter Susanna, and after her death to
her eldest son and his heirs male, and, in default of
heirs male of him, to her second son, and so on to the
seventh son, and, in default of such issue, to his <em>niece</em>
(<em>i.e.</em> granddaughter) Elizabeth Hall and her heirs male,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
and, in default of them, to his daughter Judith and her
heirs male, and, in their default, to the right heirs of the
testator.</p>

<p>Every precaution we see was here taken, but all in
vain; for, as we have hinted, it seems to be the order
of Providence that literary genius should not be the
foundation of worldly rank and greatness. Most persons
will here call to mind the parallel case of Sir Walter
Scott, who, too, as fondly and as vainly yearned to
be the founder of a part of the rural aristocracy of his
native land, and in whose eyes it was greater to be
Laird of Abbotsford than the author of Waverley. But
the advantage was on the side of the bard of Avon; for
<em>he</em> sought no literary fame, content with a life of peace
and competence, while the Scottish baronet would fain
have had literary fame as well as wealth and title.
How different were the latter days of the two men!</p>

<p class="p2">From what precedes&mdash;few, very few, as the circumstances
are&mdash;some faint idea may be formed of Shakespeare
as a man. As a poet, his works present him to
us, in all his fulness, as the most wonderful dramatic
genius that ever the world has seen, ranging with equal
ease from the lowest to the highest point of the whole
scale of the drama, from the broad farce of the Comedy
of Errors, through the enchanting light and graceful
comedy of As You Like It, and similar pieces, up to
the sublimest tragedy of Macbeth, Lear, Othello. Of
him alone can this be asserted. We have no reason to
suppose that the great tragic poets of Greece, any more
than those of France, excelled also in comedy; while
the dramatists of Spain notoriously failed in tragedy,
and their comedy, gay, spritely and animated as it is,
depends chiefly on plot and intrigue, and is greatly deficient
in variety of character.</p>

<p>Mr. Dyce has justly observed how absurd it is to say
that Shakespeare was, though the greatest, only one of
a race of contemporary giants. The poetic greatness
of Jonson, Fletcher, and Massinger was doubtless beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
that witnessed in most other ages of the world; but
surely they were but as the stars to the sun when compared
with Shakespeare. In like manner I apprehend
few will agree with the following character of Shakespeare
as a poet, drawn by Gifford in his Introduction
to the Plays of Massinger.</p>

<p>"The claims of this great poet on the admiration of
mankind are innumerable, but rhythmical modulation
is not one of them; nor do I think it either wise or
just to hold him forth as supereminent in every quality
which constitutes genius. Beaumont is as sublime,
Fletcher as pathetic, and Jonson as nervous. Nor let
it be accounted poor or niggard praise to allow him only
an equality with these extraordinary men in their peculiar
excellencies, while he is admitted to possess many
others, to which they made no approaches. Indeed if
I were asked for the discriminating quality of Shakespeare's
mind, that by which he is raised above all competition,
above all prospect of rivalry, I should say it
was <small>WIT</small>."</p>

<p>That Shakespeare possessed that <em>aroma</em> of humour
which we denominate <em>wit</em>, beyond any of his contemporaries
or successors, is a matter about which, I think,
there cannot be two opinions. I will not deny that in
nervousness Jonson may have equalled him, but I certainly
know not where to look for the sublime in Beaumont
which rivalled that of Macbeth and Lear; and
unquestionably I should never even dream of putting the
morbid softness of Fletcher in comparison with the
genuine manly pathos of Shakespeare. There was however
one thing in which I must confess they all exceeded
him&mdash;perspicuity; for though in many, very
many parts of his plays the language is most lucid and
unconstrained, there are others&mdash;in Troilus and Cressida
for instance&mdash;which task the intellect to understand
them, and which never could have been intelligible to
an ordinary audience. But the fact is, neither he nor
any other of his brother dramatists ever seems to have
asked himself the simple question, Will the audience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
understand this? I finally must assert, in opposition
to Gifford, that, where Shakespeare's verse is uninjured,
we have abundant proof that no poet ever excelled him
in "rhythmical modulation," and that, when we would
produce the most melodious verse in our language, it is
in his plays that we shall find our best specimens. It
seems to me quite idle to say with Coleridge that Shakespeare's
verse is peculiar in rhythm and structure; for,
from the nature of verse, it could not be so. It is just as
idle to say with Johnson that the blank verse of Thomson
is not that of Milton. The difference in such cases lies
wholly in the language; and that of Shakespeare <em>is</em>
peculiar. This is caused by an excess of figurative
expression, in which his metaphors are often broken and
confused and his similes imperfect, by inversions and
transpositions, and by the use of words in unusual and
even incorrect senses.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's power of observation must have been
not merely extensive but marvellous:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"He walk'd in every path of human life,</div>
<div class="i0">Felt every passion, and to all mankind</div>
<div class="i0">Doth now, will ever, that experience yield</div>
<div class="i0">Which his own genius only could acquire."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Nothing, in fact, high or low, seems to have escaped him;
he discerned the nicest shades and varieties of looks, of
manners, of language. He had also, in a remarkable
degree, that power&mdash;that clairvoyance, as we may perhaps
venture to term it&mdash;so requisite to the dramatist and
the novelist, of developing from the faintest sketch, the
merest outline, the entire of a character, with its appropriate
sentiments, action, and language. In the
number and variety of characters no writer ever equalled
him, and all are fully and completely delineated, none
are, as in other dramatists, mere sketches. Some, such
as his Clowns, are peculiar to himself; we meet with no
Clowns in the dramas of his contemporaries and successors,&mdash;the
Gracioso of the Spanish drama, an independent
creation, being the nearest approach to them. But of all
his creations what has always most astonished me are his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
women. They are exclusively his own; Fletcher, Massinger,
or any other, has nothing like them. Perhaps
the nearest approach is made in Spain also, by Cervantes;
in whom, however, as in the Spanish drama, they want
variety. They would seem to have been produced, if I
may so express it, by a projection of his own gentle and
noble nature into female forms; for he surely never met
his Rosalinds, Mirandas, and Perditas in real life, though
he <em>may</em> have had some faint sketches of some of them
in his own daughters. He seems to have shrunk almost
instinctively from portraying bad women. Goneril and
Regan alone are unredeemed; for Lady Macbeth is
awful, not detestable, and even the Queen of Cymbeline
is but an Agrippina, for like her she is criminal but
not selfish.</p>

<p>In fine, though I will not, with Mr. Buckle, term Shakespeare
"the greatest of the sons of men"&mdash;for I cannot
give that preeminence to imagination, observation, and
language over the other mental powers, so as to place him
above Aristotle and Newton&mdash;I will say here of him,
as I have said in my 'Life of Milton' that "he was the
mightiest poetic mind that Nature has ever produced,"
and that, in his case, statues and other memorials are
utterly needless and superfluous. If we are asked for
his monument, we should simply point to his Plays
and say,&mdash;<em>Monumentum si quæris, inspice!</em> and, in my
opinion, he consults best for the poet's fame who seeks to
restore his works to their pristine form.</p>

<p>The reader will see by this sketch how little is really
known concerning Shakespeare. I have endeavoured,
as will be seen, to rectify some points in his biography.</p>

<h2>EDITIONS, DATES, AND ORIGINS OF
SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1598 appeared a work, named Palladis Tamia, written
by Francis Meres, in which among other passages
respecting Shakespeare we meet with the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As Plautus and Seneca are accounted the best for
comedy and tragedy among the Latines, so Shakespeare
among the English is the most excellent in both kinds
for the stage. For comedy witness his Gentlemen of
Verona, his Errors, his Love Labour's Lost, his Love
Labour's Won, his Midsummer's Night Dream, and his
Merchant of Venice; for tragedy his Richard II., Richard
III., Henry IV., King John, Titus Andronicus,
and his Romeo and Juliet."</p>

<p>Critics have hence inferred that these were Shakespeare's
only plays written before 1598; but they have
not observed that, moved probably by a love of symmetry
and uniformity, Meres has given just half a dozen of
each; and as in reality there were only five of our author's
original tragedies then in being, he adds a play to which
he could at most have only given a few touches, omitting
the two Parts of Henry VI., for which he had done a
vast deal more. In like manner he seems in his list of
comedies to have omitted The Taming of the Shrew,
which must be regarded as the least original of the
comedies, and which the language and verse prove to
belong to this period of his plays. It is generally
agreed that Shakespeare never himself gave a play to
the press; those, then, of which there are editions
published during his lifetime, must have been printed
from copies surreptitiously obtained, perhaps from the
prompter. Hence their inaccuracies and imperfections.
There is a theory indeed that they may have been taken
down in short-hand during representation; but this
theory seems only tenable in a single instance, Henry
V., and the practice must have found a strong obstacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
in the metre, to speak of no other difficulty. My opinion
is that when once a copy of a play had been
obtained and printed, it became the groundwork of all
the subsequent editions which were printed from it,
sometimes with corrections, made by the printer himself
or by some man of letters employed by him for the purpose&mdash;except
in such cases as Romeo and Juliet, or
The Merry Wives, where the author had himself "corrected,
augmented, and amended" his play. I may add
that our forefathers, like the Orientals, had not our
ideas about adhering strictly to the text of an author.
If they thought they could improve it, they never hesitated
to do so. I will now briefly state what is of most
importance respecting the editions, the dates, and the
origins of these immortal dramas.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<h3>COMEDIES.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Comedy of Errors.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> As it is mentioned by Meres it must be anterior
to 1598. It was probably Shakespeare's first original
piece. From the plain allusion (<small>III.</small> 2) to the civil war
in France, it must have been written before February
1594, in which year Henry IV. was crowned. I have
shown above that it could not have been acted earlier
than 1593.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> It is manifestly founded on the Menæchmi
of Plautus; but Shakespeare hardly went to the original.
He may have merely got an account of that piece from
some learned friend; and there was a piece named The
Historie of Error, which was played at Hampton Court
before the Queen, on New Year's day 1576-77, which
may have been formed on the Menæchmi. The proper
title of this play seems to have been simply Errors, and
The Comedy of Errors is like The Tragedy of Macbeth,
&amp;c.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Two Gentlemen of Verona.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
</h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> Anterior to 1598 as it is in Meres's list. The
critics have not observed that the resemblance is so
strong between Act <span class="smcap">III.</span> Sc. 1 of this play, and Act <span class="smcap">I.</span>
Sc. 2 of Lyly's Midas, that the one must have been
taken from the other. In my opinion our poet was the
borrower, as his scene is so superior to Lyly's. Now
Midas was printed in 1592; but Shakespeare, it may
be said, may have seen the play acted, or he may have
written that scene, and added it to his play after he had
read Lyly's; so the present comedy might have been
written before 1592. This, however, I have shown to
be at the least very unlikely. Though in my edition
of the Plays I have given, as here, precedence to The
Comedy of Errors, I do not feel at all certain upon the
point, and would by no means assert that this is not
rather "the first heir of his [dramatic] invention."</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The plot seems to have been, in the main, of
our poet's own invention; though what relates to Proteus
and Julia may have been suggested, mediately or
immediately, by the story of Felix and Felismena in
the Diana of Montemayor. Indeed the points of resemblance
are such that I feel confident the poet must
have been acquainted with that part of the Diana; and
yet it was not translated till 1598. Might he not have
learned it from some one who had read the work in
Spanish?</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Love's Labour's Lost.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1598; in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> We have no means of ascertaining the exact
time of its composition; but from internal evidence we
must regard it as one of our author's earliest pieces, yet,
I think, later than those I have placed before it.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> It is apparently wholly our poet's own invention,
as no novel, play, or anything else at all resembling
it has been discovered.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
<span class="smcap">All's Well that Ends Well.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> Meres, as we have seen, terms one of Shakespeare's
comedies "Love Labour's Won." Among our
author's extant comedies there is none with that title,
and we have no reason whatever for supposing any original
play of his to be lost; while on the other hand
the subject of the present play accords most accurately
with that title. It has therefore been conjectured, with
great probability, that this is one of Shakespeare's early
plays, which he altered and improved at a later period,
giving it at the same time a new title. We can certainly
discern in it the style and mode of composition of
two different periods&mdash;the riming scenes, for instance, belonging
to the earlier one. It is to be observed of these
riming scenes, that they only occur in the three preceding
plays, and in Romeo and Juliet, in all which plays
soliloquies, letters, &amp;c. are in stanzas&mdash;like the sonnets
in Spanish plays; and the very same is the case in the
present play, and in it alone of the later ones; whence
we may fairly conclude that it belonged to the early
period. The second act seems to retain, both in the
serious and the comic scenes, much of the original play
unaltered; and every one must be struck with the resemblance
of the style in it to that of Love's Labour's
Lost.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The tale of Giletta di Narbona in Boccaccio's
Decameron, which Shakespeare may have read in the
original, or in the translation in Painter's Palace of
Pleasure. The comic scenes are, of course, our author's
own, as usual.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Midsummer-Night's Dream.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to (by Fisher), 1600; 4to (by Roberts),
1600; in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> Anterior to 1598, as it is mentioned by Meres.
I <em>do</em> think that in Act <small>II.</small> Sc. 1 there is an allusion
to the state of the weather in the summer of 1594, and
that Shakespeare may have been writing this play at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
that very time. I therefore incline to give that year, or
1595, as the date of its composition.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Purely and absolutely the whole the poet's
own invention. He was well read in Chaucer, in Golding's
Ovid, and in North's Plutarch, where he got the
names of his characters and some circumstances.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Taming of the Shrew.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> We have no means of ascertaining the exact
date of this play; but the style proves it to belong to
Shakespeare's early period. The reason of its omission
by Meres has been already given.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> It is a <em>rifacimento</em> of an anonymous play,
first printed in 1594, though perhaps written and acted
some time earlier, and termed "The Taming of a Shrew,"
and it may be anterior to the Midsummer-Night's
Dream; the date 1594 would seem to have some connexion
with both plays. The incident of the Pedant
personating Vincentio was taken from The Supposes,
a translation by Gascoigne of Ariosto's I Suppositi.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Merchant of Venice.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to (by Roberts), 1600; 4to (by Heyes),
1600; in the folio, 1623. The two 4tos are in effect
the same; for Heyes's was printed by J. R., <em>i.e.</em> James
Roberts, who probably had contrived to get a transcript
from the copy in the theatre, and then may have made
some arrangement with Heyes for the publication.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> It is in Meres's list, and it was entered by Roberts
in the Stationers' Registers 22nd July 1598; so that
it was probably first acted in that or the preceding year.
It is, I think, certainly later than any of the preceding
comedies.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The remote origin of the incidents both of
the bond and of the caskets is the Gesta Romanorum
portions of which had been translated and published by
Robinson in 1577. The incident of the bond is also
in Il Pecorone of Ser Giovanni Fiorentino, first printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
in 1558, and which Shakespeare may have read. There
was also a ballad on the subject, in Percy's Reliques,
with which he may have been acquainted.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">As You Like It.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> It is posterior to 1598, as Meres does not mention
it, and was entered in the Stationer's Registers,
August 4, 1600, by the booksellers Wise and Aspley;
but for some reason, which we cannot now discover, they
did not print it.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> It is founded on Lodge's novel of Rosalynde,
of which the chief origin was The Coke's Tale of Gamelyn,
ascribed, but wrongly, to Chaucer. The characters
of Jaques, Touchstone, and Audrey, and of course
all the comic scenes, are Shakespeare's own.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Much Ado About Nothing.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1600; in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> Not being mentioned by Meres, it is posterior
to 1598; and as it is said, in the title-page of the 4to,
that "it hath been sundry times publicly acted," it may
have been written in 1598, and may be older than As
You Like It; but we have no means of deciding.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The story of Ariodante and Ginevra in the
Orlando Furioso, which Shakespeare may have read
either in the original or in Sir John Harington's translation,
published in 1591. The story had also been
translated by Beverley and Turberville; and there was a
play on it, performed before the Queen on Shrove
Tuesday 1582-83; so that it was well known. Shakespeare's
other authority was the novel of Timbreo di
Cardona, &amp;c., in Bandello, in which occur the names
<em>Pietro di Aragona</em>, <em>Messina</em>, and Felicia <em>Lionata</em>, and
with which therefore Shakespeare must have been acquainted.
As there was no known translation of it,
save a French one in Belleforest's <em>Histoires Tragiques</em>,
I am of opinion that Shakespeare had read the original
Italian. It need hardly be added that all the comic
scenes and characters are our author's own.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Merry Wives of Windsor.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1602; 4to, 1619; in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> It was entered in the Stationers' Registers 18th
January 1601-02, and was, consequently, written between
1597 (it is not in Meres's list) and that date;
but we have no means of ascertaining the exact time.
Mr. Dyce thinks it was written before 1600. It may
be observed that, though some of the characters are the
same as those in Henry IV. and Henry V., it is quite
independent of these plays. I must here remark that
the play is so brief, and, as it were, elementary, in the
4tos as compared with the folio, that it seems quite clear
that the poet revised and augmented it some time after
its first appearance; and this gives some probability to
the tradition of its having been written at the command
of the Queen, and in a few days, possibly in 1598
or 1599. Further, as in the 4tos there is no allusion
whatever to the Lucy coat of arms, it is highly improbable
that the poet showed in it any ill feeling towards
that family. Lastly, the occurrence in the 4tos of
numerous riming couplets which are not in the folio,
completely upsets Mr. Collier's theory of that edition
having been made up from memory, and from notes
taken at the theatre. The expression "<em>king's</em> English"
(<small>I.</small> 4) might seem to indicate that the enlargement of
the play was not made till after the accession of
James. The change, however, of <em>queen</em> to <em>king</em> may have
been made by the Editors; but surely Shakespeare
must have been aware that Falstaff lived in the time of
the Henries.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Though some Italian and English tales are
referred to as the possible sources of the plot, we may,
I think, regard it as, at least in the greater part, Shakespeare's
own invention. There is, however, a strong
resemblance in part of it to a German play by Duke
Henry Julius of Brunswick, who died in 1611. See on
The Tempest.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Twelfth Night.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> We learn from the MS. diary of a barrister
named Manningham, that this play was performed in
the Middle Temple, on the 2nd of February 1601-02.
It was therefore written between <span class="err" title="original: 1697">1597</span> and that date;
but the exact time is quite uncertain.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The more remote origin of this play is apparently
one of the tales of Bandello, which Shakespeare
may have read in the original, or in a French or English
version of it; for there were such. But the Rev. Jos.
Hunter directed attention to three Italian comedies, two
named "Inganni"&mdash;one of which is noticed by Manningham&mdash;and
a third named "Gl'Ingannati," or "Il
Sacrificio;" and the resemblance between this last and
Twelfth Night is so strong that it is hardly possible to
suppose that Shakespeare was unacquainted with it.
If so, as it was never translated, as far as we know, he
must have read it in the original Italian, which was
printed in 1537.</p>

<p>N.B. The reader will observe with respect to these
last four comedies, that all that we know with certainty
respecting their date is that they were written between
1597 and 1600 or 1602. The arranging of them is
little more than guess-work. I have placed first those
that we <em>know</em> to have been written before 1600.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Measure For Measure.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> In the Accounts of the Revels at Court, we
are informed that this play was performed at Whitehall
December 26, 1604. It was therefore probably written
in that or the preceding year.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> "The right excellent and famous History of
Promos and Cassandra, a drama in Two Parts, by
George Whetstone," published in 1578. Whetstone's
drama was taken from one of the tales in the Hecatommithi
of Cinthio, which Shakespeare may also have
read. The comic scenes are of course all his own.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The Winter's Tale.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> It appears from the MS. diary of Dr. Forman,
that he saw this play performed at the Globe, May 15,
1611; it was also performed at Whitehall on the 5th
of November following. Its exact date cannot be assigned;
but the great probability is that it could not
have been written earlier than 1610. I am disposed to
regard it as anterior to The Tempest, which was probably
the last play that ever Shakespeare wrote. When
we consider the probable date of this play, we see how
utterly untenable is the theory of some writers that it
was an indirect apology for Anne Boleyn, and a direct
compliment to her royal daughter. I may here observe
that those ingenious persons who find allusions (except
in a very few plain instances) to public events and
public persons in Shakespeare's plays merely waste
their own and their readers' time. Thus Sir Philip
Sidney died the very year the poet came to London; and
yet we are told that he is figured in Hamlet, a play
not written till many years afterwards!</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> With the exception of the comic scenes&mdash;which
as usual are wholly Shakespeare's own&mdash;it was
founded on Green's popular novel of Pandosto, The
Triumph of Time.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Tempest.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> As it (<span class="smcap">II.</span> 1) copies a passage from Florio's
translation of Montaigne's Essays, published in 1603,
we may assume that it is posterior to that year; and
Malone has directed attention to the shipwreck of Sir
George Somers on the island of Bermuda in July 1609,
which may have suggested the scene of "The Tempest."
We may therefore venture to assume that it may have
been written not long after the account of that event
reached England.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Collins, the poet, told Warton that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
seen a romance called "Aurelio and Isabella," printed
in Italian, Spanish, French, and English in 1588, which
was the original of the Tempest. But no such romance
has ever been discovered, and it may justly be
questioned if ever such a one existed. Still it is not
improbable that Shakespeare may have heard or read
some story of people cast away on a desert island.
There is also a German play by Jacob Ayrer of Nuremberg,
who died early in the seventeenth century, named
"Die schöne Sidea," which in its plot and principal
characters, bears so strong a resemblance to The Tempest
that it is very difficult to avoid supposing a connexion
between them; and it might thence appear that Collins
was correct, for Shakespeare could hardly have had any
knowledge of a German drama. It may, however, be
said that he got his knowledge of the plot, &amp;c., from
one of the English actors who, as it is now well known,
used to go over and perform in Germany.</p>

<h3>HISTORIES.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Life and Death of King John.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> Anterior to 1598, as it is in Meres's list.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> It was founded on a play called "The First
and Second Part of the Troublesome Reign of King John
of England," published in 1591.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Life and Death of King Richard II.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1597; 4to, 1598; 4to, 1608; 4to, 1615;
in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> The exact date cannot be ascertained; but from
the style I should be inclined to regard it as one of
Shakespeare's earliest plays.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Hollinshed's Chronicle, and an older play on
the same subject.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The First Part of King Henry IV.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1598; 4to, 1599; 4to, 1604; 4to, 1608;
4to, 1613; in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> All we can say is, that it was anterior to 1598,
and was most probably written in 1597.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Hollinshed's Chronicle, and an anonymous
play called "The Famous Victories of Henry V." The
comic scenes are entirely Shakespeare's own, both in this
and the two succeeding plays.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Second Part of King Henry IV.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1600; in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> Apparently in one of the years between 1597
and 1600. As has been already observed, it could hardly
have been in existence when Meres wrote, or he would
not have placed Titus Andronicus in his list. It is
an objection that before 1597 Shakespeare had changed
the name Oldcastle to Falstaff in the First Part, while
in the 4to edition of this play a speech (<span class="smcap">I.</span> 2) has the
prefix <em>Old.</em> instead of <em>Fal.</em> But surely that may have
been a slip of the copyist's memory, in consequence of
<em>Oldcastle</em> having been the original title.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The same as of the First Part.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Life of King Henry V.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1600; 4to, 1602; 4to, 1608; in the
folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> As in the chorus to Act <span class="smcap">V.</span> there is an evident
allusion to the expedition of the Earl of Essex to Ireland,
whither he went in April 1599, and whence he
returned in the following September, it would seem
to be clear that the play was acted in the interval between
those two months. The insertion of this passage
seems to be inexplicable on any other hypothesis. This
also proves that the choruses formed a part of the original
play, though they are not to be found in the 4to
editions, which, it is well known, are scandalously imperfect.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The same as that of the two preceding plays.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The Life and Death of King Richard III.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1597; 4to, 1598; 4to, 1602; 4to, 1605;
in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> Anterior, of course, to 1597. I incline to regard
it as posterior to King John and to Richard II.;
for it has no stanzas and no riming passages. It is also
very free from quibbles and plays upon words, except in
the unfortunate soliloquy of Richard in the last act&mdash;a
wonderful instance of want of taste, and even of judgment.
The same may be said of the scenes between
Richard and Lady Anne and the Queen.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Hollinshed, and probably More.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Life of King Henry VIII.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> The following memorandum is in the Stationers'
Registers:&mdash;"12 Feb. 1604[-5]. Nath. Butter. Yf he
get good allowance for the Interlude of K. Henry the
8th, before he begin to print it, &amp;c." This has been
supposed to be the present play; but the style militates
against this supposition. I offer the following proof,
which has never, that I am aware of, been observed.
In his early plays Shakespeare very rarely puts the preposition
or conjunction at the end of one line and the
noun or verb at the beginning of the next; in his
succeeding ones he does so more frequently, and in
his latest he is rather profuse of the practice. Now
this construction is as frequent in Henry VIII. as in
Coriolanus, Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and his other
later ones, whence it might seem that it should be
referred to the same epoch. We are told, indeed, that
in 1613 the Globe Theatre was set on fire and burned
down by the discharge of chambers in a new play called
"Henry VIII.;" but it is hardly possible that it could
be this play, as Shakespeare had retired before that year.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Hollinshed's Chronicle.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
TRAGEDIES.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Romeo and Juliet.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1597; 4to, 1599; 4to, 1609; in the
folio, 1623. There is also an undated 4to issued by
Smethwick, the publisher of that of 1609, in which
many typographical errors are corrected.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> In Act <span class="smcap">I.</span> Sc. 2, the Nurse says, "'Tis since
the earthquake now eleven years;" and, as Tyrwhitt
justly observed, this could only have been the earthquake
which was felt in England on the 6th of April
1580. It was quite in Shakespeare's way to make the
allusion; and this would give 1591 as the year in which
this play was first performed. This, then, <em>may</em> be the
true date, though I greatly doubt of it; I should rather
say, entirely reject it; for it surely can hardly be anterior
to the first two comedies. The play, as appears
from the 4to, 1597, was little more than a sketch of that
which appeared, "corrected, augmented, and amended,"
in 1599.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The remote original is the tale of Pyramus
and Thisbe in Ovid's Metamorphoses, from which an
Italian writer named Luigi da Porto made a tale,
printed in 1535. A tale formed from this was given by
Bandello in 1554; and in 1562 a poem of Romeus and
Juliet, by Arthur Brookes, taken from Bandello's, or
rather from the version of it in Belleforest's Histoires
Tragiques, was published in London; in 1567 the same
tale, also from Bandello, appeared in Painter's Palace
of Pleasure. Shakespeare chiefly followed Brooke; but
he had also read the Palace of Pleasure, and probably
Bandello's tale in the original.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Hamlet.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1603; 4to, 1604; 4to, 1611; 4to undated
(probably in 1607); in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> On the 26th of July 1602, an entry was made
in the Stationers' Registers of "A Booke, The Revenge
of Hamlett, prince of Denmarke, as yt was latelie acted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
by the Lord Chambelayn his servantes." There can be
little doubt that this was the present play. The text of
the 4to, 1603, is in such a mangled, wretched condition,
that it has not unreasonably been conjectured that it
was formed from notes made during the representation.
As in this the Polonius and Reynaldo of the present play
are called Corambis and Montano, it is probable that the
play received much addition and alteration; for the 4to,
1604, gives it "enlarged to almost as much again as it
was, according to the true and perfect coppie." This play
being so popular, it is not unlikely that the author may
have frequently retouched it. It is very remarkable
that it is by many degrees the most faulty of his plays,
abounding, we may say, in incongruities, contradictions,
and improbabilities.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Apparently a novel called The Hystorie of
Hamblet, translated from Belleforest. There seems also
to have been an older play on the subject.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Othello.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1622; in the folio, 1623. There is also
a 4to, 1630; but it is of little value, as it was evidently
made not from a MS., but from the two preceding editions
with some conjectural emendations. To the 4to,
1622, is prefixed&mdash;as to Troilus and Cressida&mdash;an
Epistle "from the Stationer [Thos. Walkley] to the
Reader."</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> From the Accounts of the Revels, we learn
that this play was performed at Court, November 1st,
1604; and if the Egerton Papers, published by Mr.
Collier, can be relied on, it had been performed before
Queen Elizabeth. In them we meet as follows:&mdash;"6
August, 1602. Rewards to the vaulters, players, and
dancers&mdash;of this x<sup>li</sup> to Burbidge's players for Othello&mdash;lxiiii<sup>li</sup>
xviii<sup>s</sup> x<sup>d</sup>." "The part of the memorandum
which relates to Othello," says Mr. Collier, "is interlined
as if added afterwards." Mr. Halliwell asserts that
Othello must have been written even before 1600; for
in a MS. of that date, entitled The Newe Metamorphosis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
&amp;c., is a passage evidently, he thinks, imitated
from "who steals my purse steals trash" in Othello.
But, though Mr. Halliwell thinks otherwise, this passage
may have been a later insertion; or it may be a mere
coincidence, a thing much more common than is usually
supposed. At all events Othello was written, at
latest, in 1604. I know not if it has been observed
that Voltaire evidently had Othello in his mind when
writing his Zaïre.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The only known source of this play is a tale
in the Hecatommithi of Cinthio; and as no English
translation of it is known to have existed, the obvious
and natural inference is that Shakespeare had read it in
the original. There was, however, it seems, a French
translation: Paris, 1584.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Julius Cæsar.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> The real date of this play is very uncertain, and
I am very dubious whether I am right or not in giving
it this position. Mr. Collier&mdash;with whom Mr. Dyce
agrees&mdash;is positive that it appeared before 1603, for
in that year Drayton published his Barons' Wars, in
which is a passage so like the character of Brutus given
in this play (v. 5), that one poet must have borrowed
from the other; and it is inferred of course that Drayton
was the borrower. But this is not by any means so
certain, as the eagle did not always disdain to take a
plume from the smaller birds (see above, The Two
Gentlemen of Verona). It is very strange, however,
that neither of these critics seems to have been aware
that the very same ideas, and even expressions, are to
be found in the character given of Crites in Ben Jonson's
Cynthia's Revels (ii. 1), which was performed in 1600,
and which may therefore I think justly be regarded as
the real immediate original of the passages in both
poets; the germ, however, is to be found in Chaucer's
Tale of the Doctor of Physik. All, then, that we can
venture to affirm is, that Julius Cæsar is posterior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
1600. I incline to place it in point of time before
Shakespeare's other plays on Roman subjects. It may
be observed that his Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus
are as much Histories as those that are so
entitled, the history being Roman instead of English.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> North's Plutarch, from the French of Amyot.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Antony and Cleopatra.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> From the language of this play I feel inclined
to place its date near that of Julius Cæsar. It is true
that "A Booke called Anthony and Cleopatra," which
may have been this play, was entered in the Stationers'
Registers, May 20th, 1608; but it seems never to have
appeared, and that entry is no proof that the play may
not have been acted some years before that date.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Life of Antonius in North's Plutarch.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">King Lear.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> 4to, 1608; 4to, 1608; 4to, 1608; in the
folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> Certainly posterior to 1603, in which year appeared
Harsnet's Discovery of Popish Impostures, from
which Shakespeare evidently took the names of the fiends
mentioned by Edgar. There is an entry of it in the
Stationers' Registers, November 26th, 1607, in which it
is stated that it had been played before the King on the
night of St. Stephen's Day in the preceding year. The
latest date of its composition, then, that we can suppose
is 1606.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Hollinshed, Mirror of Magistrates, and an
old play on the same subject. The episode of Gloster
and his sons was taken from Sidney's Arcadia, ii. 10.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Macbeth.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> Dr. Forman states in his MS. Diary that he saw
this play "at the Globe, 1610, the 20th of April, Saturday;"
but it does not follow by any means that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
then a new play. I agree with Mr. Collier in thinking
that the mention of "twofold balls and treble sceptres"
should induce us to place it not very far from the accession
of James I. (Oct. 24, 1604), and therefore in 1605
or 1606. Malone thought there was an allusion (in <span class="smcap">II.</span> 3)
to the state of the corn-market in 1606, and to the conduct
of the Jesuit Garnet on his trial in that year; but
this is little more than fancy.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Hollinshed's Chronicle.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Troilus and Cressida.</span></h4>

<p><em>Editions.</em> 4to, 1609; in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> It was entered in the Stationers' Registers, January
28, 1608-9. It had not been acted at that time;
for the publishers state, in an Address to the Reader, that
it had never been "staled with the stage, never clapper-clawed
with the palms of the vulgar;" while in a reissue
of it in the same year the Address was suppressed, and
it was given "as it was acted by the King's Majesty's
servants at the Globe." It is therefore evident that it
was first acted in 1609; but it might have been written
some years earlier. It is a very curious question, and
one to which I am unable to give a satisfactory answer,
how it came into the hands of the publisher. I entirely
disagree with those critics who think they discern in it
the hand of another poet; for there is not a play in the
whole collection more thoroughly Shakespearian in every
scene. The conclusion certainly is huddled up in a way
not elsewhere to be met with in these plays; but that is
no proof of this theory; for if Shakespeare had taken
up the work of another, the conclusion is the very
part he would have been most likely to develope. It
is further very remarkable, that though this play was
not exposed to the wear and tear of the property-room,
it contains more imperfect lines than almost any other.
This I can only attribute to the haste and carelessness
of the transcriber, who, as working surreptitiously, was
anxious to hurry through his task in as short a time as
possible. I will observe, in fine, that, though it contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
the death of Hector&mdash;which might perhaps better have
been omitted&mdash;it is in reality a tragi-comedy, as much
so as any of Beaumont and Fletcher's.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Chaucer's Troilus and Cresseida, Caxton's
Recuyl of the Historyes of Troye, and Lydgate's Historye,
Sege, and Destruccyon of Troye.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Timon of Athens.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> We have no means of ascertaining the exact
date; but the language and the use of rimes in the dialogue
induce me to think that it was near that of Troilus
and Cressida.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The story of Timon in Painter's Palace of
Pleasure, and life of Antony in North's Plutarch.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Coriolanus.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> A little later, I think, than the two preceding
plays; for there is only one riming passage in it.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> Life of Coriolanus in North's Plutarch.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cymbeline.</span></h4>

<p><em>Edition.</em> Only in the folio, 1623.</p>

<p><em>Date.</em> From the style and the family resemblance&mdash;as
appears to me&mdash;between Imogen, Miranda, and Perdita,
I should deem it to be contemporaneous with the Tempest
and the Winter's Tale. We may place it, then,
in or after 1610.</p>

<p><em>Origin.</em> The tale of Bernabò da Genova in the Decamerone,
which Shakespeare had probably read in the
original. There was an imitation of it in a tract called
Westward for Smelts, of which, however, no edition
earlier than 1620 is known. For the historical part, he,
of course, had resorted to Hollinshed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="p2">In these plays we may, I think, distinguish four different
phases of composition, in each of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
thoughts and the language of the poet present a peculiar
appearance.</p>

<p>The <em>first</em> phase extends we may say from 1593 to
1598, and contains the plays in Meres's list&mdash;except
1 Henry IV., and The Merchant of Venice, and The
Taming of the Shrew. It is distinguished by a continual
play on words and by frequent rimes&mdash;both in
couplets and in stanzas&mdash;while the blank verse, which
is as yet unformed, is harmonious and almost always
decasyllabic. Richard III. seems to form the connecting
link between this and the next phase; for it is free
from both rimes and play on words, while the blank
verse has not yet acquired its appropriate form.</p>

<p>The <em>second</em> phase would seem to extend from 1598 to
1603. It contains The Merchant of Venice, As You
Like It, Much Ado about Nothing, The Merry Wives
of Windsor, Twelfth Night, 1 and 2 Henry IV.,
Henry V., Hamlet, Othello, Julius Cæsar, Antony
and Cleopatra. Here the dramatic blank verse is
perfect, trisyllabic feet being admitted, and the lines
running into each other, rimes only appearing in final
couplets. There rarely occurs a play on words, and the
language is in general easy and natural.</p>

<p>The <em>third</em> phase may extend from 1603 to 1609.
It contains Measure for Measure, Lear, Macbeth,
Troilus and Cressida, Timon of Athens, and Coriolanus.
In this the poet returned to the practice of
giving passages of several lines in rime, though not in
stanzas, and his language is obscured by periphrases,
inversions, and ellipses to such an extent that many
places&mdash;the speeches of Ulysses, for instance, in Troilus
and Cressida&mdash;must have been perfectly unintelligible
to an ordinary audience. He had already, as in Antony
and Cleopatra, begun to place more frequently the preposition
or conjunction at the end of one line and the
word connected with it at the beginning of the next, and
he continues to do so here, chiefly in Coriolanus, though
hardly at all in Troilus and Cressida, or in Timon of
Athens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>

The <em>fourth</em> and last phase contains The Winter's
Tale, The Tempest, Henry VIII., Cymbeline. He here
seems to have made a return to the simpler language
of the second phase. In Henry VIII. and The Tempest,
what has been said of prepositions and conjunctions
goes on to a great extent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="p2">The plays above noticed&mdash;thirty-two in number&mdash;are
the genuine productions of the poet. Two of them,
King John and The Taming of the Shrew, were
founded on plays that are still extant, and we may see
that he used them precisely as he did the tales and
chronicles on which he founded so many of his other
plays, taking the story, the incidents, the characters, and,
when it suited his purpose, the language which they
contained.</p>

<p>But beside these, we find in the folio four other plays
of a different kind, of which the most that any critic
ventures to assert is that they were retouched, improved,
and enlarged by Shakespeare. Of two of these, namely
The Second and Third Parts of Henry VI. this would
seem to be the truth; for we have the two plays in their
original form, and there can be little doubt that it was
them chiefly that Green had in view in the passage
quoted above from his Groat's Worth of Wit, &amp;c.; and
upon examination it appears that in the first of them
Shakespeare's additions and improvements amount to a
fifth, in the second to only an eighth part of the text.
Of the other two, The First Part of Henry VI. and
Titus Andronicus, after a very careful study of them,
my decided opinion, and apparently that of Mr. Dyce
also, is that, with an exception presently to be noticed,
neither the one nor the other contains a single speech or
even a single line from the pen of Shakespeare. How
they got into the folio is a question not easy to answer.
Heminge and Condell, no doubt, may not have been
critics, and so may have fancied that he had had to do
with The First Part of Henry VI. also; or they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
have merely inserted it as being connected with the
other Parts. As to Titus Andronicus, I have already
given a reason for its appearance in Meres's list. He
had probably heard that it was by Shakespeare, and he
made no exact inquiry, and so ascribed it to him; and
the editors of the folio may have taken it on his authority,
or have followed the same tradition. I do not believe
that it was at any time in Shakespeare's nature to
write the horrors of one of these plays, or to treat the
noble Maid of Orleans as she is treated in the other, or
even to labour on and improve the pieces that contained
them. Besides, there are nowhere to be found plays
more entirely of one single cast than these are. There
is also displayed in them an acquaintance with Horace
and others of the ancient Classics which Shakespeare did
not possess. They may have been written by either
Kyd or Marlow, each of whom had this acquaintance,
and also a taste for horrors, and abundant talent for
their composition. At the same time I think it possible
that, as there is a Clown in Titus Andronicus&mdash;the only
instance I believe out of the plays of Shakespeare&mdash;the
two short, trifling, and needless scenes in which he appears
may be from our poet's pen, and that hence the
play was hastily ascribed to him.</p>

<p>The following plays also were published during
Shakespeare's life-time with his name, in full or in
initials, on the title-pages: Locrine, 1595; The Life of
Sir John Oldcastle, 1600&mdash;known to be by Munday,
Drayton, Wilson, and Hathway; History of Thomas Lord
Cromwell, 1602; The London Prodigal, 1605; The Puritan,
or The Widow of Watling Street, 1607; A Yorkshire
Tragedy, 1608. These, with Pericles, Prince of
Tyre&mdash;also published under his name in 1609&mdash;were
printed in the 3rd folio, 1664, and reprinted in the 4th,
1685, and finally by Rowe in his edition of Shakespeare's
Plays. The Two Noble Kinsmen, by Fletcher
and Shakespeare, was published in 1634.</p>

<p>Of the first six of these plays the opinion of the
critics is tolerably unanimous that Shakespeare had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
whatever to do with them. Yet, as in Locrine
(printed so early as 1595) it is said, "newly set forth,
overseen and corrected, by W. S." it is possible, though
most unlikely, that it may be one of the plays on which
he operated in the early part of his dramatic career;
and the fame of his Poems lately printed, may have induced
the publisher to place his initials in the title-page.
As to Pericles, it was rejected, with Locrine, &amp;c., by Pope,
Theobald, and all the editors down to Malone, who printed
all these pieces in 1780 in the Supplement to the edition
of Johnson and Steevens; he did not, however, include
any of them in his own edition of 1790. Steevens
admitted Pericles into his edition of 1793 on the authority
of Farmer, but marked with an asterisk, as being
only in part Shakespeare's, to which opinion Malone,
who at first thought it wholly his, acceded. It finally
was included in Reed's and in the Boswell-Malone or
Variorum edition, which succeeding editors have followed.
From <em>mine</em> it has been excluded, as I am most
firmly of opinion that it does not contain a single line of
Shakespeare's, and that it is an insult to his memory to
give it a place among his genuine works. In fact the
deliberate rejection of it by Heminge and Condell from
the folio ought to outweigh all conjectural proofs in its
favour. These, we must recollect, were not ordinary
players, they were Shakespeare's <em>fellows</em> or partners in
the theatres; and it was therefore utterly impossible that
any play could be acted there without their knowing who
was the author. They must, then, have <em>known</em> that Shakespeare
had had nothing to do with it; for their admission
of 1 Hen. VI. and Titus Andronicus proves that
evidence even of the slenderest kind would have turned
the beam with them. His name at full length in the
title-page proves nothing; for it is also in that of Sir
John Oldcastle, 1600, which is <em>known</em> not to be his.</p>

<p>As to the Two Noble Kinsmen, it was published in
1634 as "written by the memorable worthies of their
time, Mr. John Fletcher and Mr. William Shakespeare"&mdash;putting
the greater last&mdash;an evident bookseller's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
artifice; for surely Shakespeare at the zenith of his fame,
and toward the close of his dramatic career, would not
join with a young poet in the composition of a play, a
thing that he never seems to have done, even when he
was a young poet himself. Mr. Dyce, who had rejected,
afterwards adopted the theory of its being in a certain
sense a joint composition; and he makes some strange
hypotheses upon the subject, which to me seem utterly
devoid of probability. Surely, for example, it is not to
be supposed that a man of Shakespeare's business-habits
would, when winding-up, as we may term it, leave behind
him, in the hands of the House, an unfinished
drama, and that what he left should have been the beginning
and the end of a play! It is pretty generally
agreed that the entire play, except the first and fifth
acts, is by Fletcher. To me it seems certain that the
first act, though the work of a superior poet, is not
Shakespeare's; and I feel quite confident that the first,
as well as the second, scene of the last act is by Fletcher;
while the concluding scenes are by some other
poet, different from, and, I think, superior to, the writer
of the first act. My theory is, that Fletcher either
obtained the commencement of a play by some one else,
or began to write in conjunction with some one, and,
the play being unfinished at his death, it was concluded
by another poet, possibly Massinger, who alone seems
capable of writing such a noble termination of so fine a
drama.</p>

<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Text.</span></h3>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> reading and criticising the plays of Shakespeare,
we must always bear in mind that they were written
for the stage, not for the closet, to be acted, not to be
read. Shakespeare, as it would appear, was utterly regardless
of literary fame; he had, as we have seen, one
sole object in view, to acquire as much money as would
enable him to quit the hurry and bustle of London, and
settle down in his native Stratford-on-Avon as a man
of independent property, and be, if possible, the founder
of a family. Pouring forth, therefore, his tragic and
comic strains, with as little apparent effort as the songsters
of the grove warble their native notes, he set no
value on them but as they filled the Globe and the
Blackfriars and thus tended to the realization of the
great object of all his ambition; and he never gave a
single one of them to the press, as was done by Jonson
and others who sought for literary fame by their dramas.
Hence, though the verse is always melodious, we must
not look in them for the finish and perfection which we
find in those of a Racine or a Molière; we must, on the
contrary, be prepared to meet with all the marks of
haste and carelessness, with contradictions and even with
absurdities. It would really dismay one to think of
their being submitted to the ordeal through which the
pieces of the great Corneille have been made to pass by
Voltaire. Corneille, by the way, like Shakespeare, valued
his plays by the money they produced.</p>

<p>Copies of about one-half of his plays were surreptitiously
obtained by the booksellers, who printed them
with more or less of care; but of this he took no heed:
and when he finally retired to Stratford, he left in the
hands of his fellowplayers the manuscripts of his plays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
published and unpublished. There is not the slightest
ground for supposing that he ever had any intention of
collecting and publishing his dramatic writings&mdash;a thing
of which there had as yet been no instance. In 1616,
the very year of Shakespeare's death, Ben Jonson, who,
widely different from the great dramatist, set a high
value, and a just one, on his plays as literary compositions,
collected all he had written up to that date and
published them, with his other poetical pieces, in a folio
volume. It may have been this that induced Heminge
and Condell, two members of the company to which
Shakespeare had belonged, to make a collection of <em>his</em>
pieces also, and give them to the world in a folio volume.
For this purpose they used the 4to impressions of such
plays as had been printed, making some corrections and
alterations in them from the playhouse copies; and
adding to these the manuscript plays which were in the
possession of the theatre, they put the whole into the
hands of the publishers, one of whom, Edward Blount,
who was a man of some literary pretensions, is supposed,
not without probability, to have undertaken the
task of seeing the work through the press. Such was
the origin of the celebrated folio of 1623, of which it
was, in my opinion most justly, said by the late Mr.
Hunter, that "perhaps in the whole annals of English
typography there is no record of any book of any extent
and any reputation having been dismissed from the
press with less care and attention;" while Mr. Knight
(who ought to have known a good deal about such
matters) boldly declares that "perhaps, all things considered,
there never was a book so correctly printed!"
Such as it is, however, it and the previous 4to impressions
are the <em>only</em> authority we have for the text of these
marvellous creations of the human intellect.</p>

<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Few, I should hope, will refuse to assent to the two
following postulates.</p>

<p>I. No eminent writer&mdash;however he might obscure his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
meaning by metaphor, ellipsis, or other figures of speech&mdash;has
ever written pure nonsense.</p>

<p>II. No true poet ever wrote limping, imperfect, or
inharmonious verses.</p>

<p>We may add to these the plain facts, that printers are
not, and never were, infallible, and that those works of
which the authors themselves read the proof-sheets are
in general more correct than those of which those sheets
were read by others.</p>

<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Now the plays of Shakespeare are, as is well known,
full of passages of which it is nearly impossible to make
any good sense, and they abound in imperfect and inharmonious
verses. On the other hand, the poems of
Venus and Adonis, and of Lucrece, which he himself
probably saw through the press, are almost entirely free
from error, and do not contain a single unmelodious
verse. The natural inference, then, is, that the defects
of the plays are all owing to the transcribers and printers,
and that the correction of them and the restoration
of sense and melody, when possible, is the legitimate
office of sound emendatory criticism. The truth of this
has been felt from the very beginning; for in the 2nd
folio, published in 1632, only nine years after the first,
there are numerous corrections, which must have been
made by the editor solely on his own authority, for, many
of them being very bad, he could not have derived them
from any manuscripts. And the same is the case in the
subsequent folios, of all of which there are many copies
in existence, like that which Mr. Collier met with to
his misfortune, and which has excited such a storm in a
puddle,&mdash;of which, by the way, my own opinion is that
the corrections in it were made between 1744, the date
of Hanmer's, and 1765, that of Johnson's edition; whence
I only cite it for the corrections later than the former
date. These contain manuscript corrections, some, like
that copy, anonymously, others by Southern and other
men of repute. In the beginning of the last century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Rowe gave the first example of an annotated edition of
Shakespeare's works, and from that time to the present
edition has succeeded edition bearing the names of critics
of various degrees of ability and eminence, but all agreeing
in the necessity of revising the text and rendering
it as correct as may be possible.</p>

<p>Of the early editors, Rowe and Pope made little more
than the most obvious corrections, Warburton, always
ingenious and almost always wrong, made notwithstanding
some that were very good, as also did Hanmer. But
they were all eclipsed by Theobald, one of the acutest
emendatory critics that this country has produced, whose
merits, though long clouded through the malignity of
Pope, are now fully acknowledged. Capell, the next in
order of time, also rendered good service; but Johnson,
Steevens, and Malone have done much less than might
have been expected. Of these the last was a native of
Ireland, the only emendatory critic that country has
produced; and, in my opinion, he is not at all inferior to
his English rival Steevens. That true critic Tyrwhitt
should also be noticed as an emendator of a high order.
It is surprising how little has really been done in
the present century; and I was perfectly astonished to
find what a number of passages still remained in a corrupt
or imperfect state when I ventured on the task of
emendation. It would seem as if critical sagacity, low
in rank as it may be, is one of those talents most rarely
bestowed; and besides, print appears to exercise almost
a magic power over most persons; they seem to think
that what is in print cannot be wrong: it is in fact
only very few minds that can fully emancipate themselves
from its influence. It must, however, be remembered
that alteration and critical emendation are widely
different. The former is in the power of almost any
one; the latter, as I said, requires a peculiar faculty.
It is a curious fact that in nothing does critical sagacity
show itself more than in, as I may say, seeing what is
before the eyes. For an instance see the first note on
Henry V. Another curious fact is this, that poets (Coleridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
for example) are rarely good emendators. It is,
in fine, the merest folly, and a proof of the grossest
ignorance, to sneer at such labours and represent them
as needless, if not mischievous. Editors, however, ought
to be very cautious about introducing their conjectures
into the text, and should place them only in notes, unless
when they are such as must almost command assent, and
the place corrected had previously yielded no tolerable
sense or metric melody. It is a good rule to let well
alone, as we say, and not to alter what gives tolerable
good sense. I have, I believe, transgressed this rule
only in a couple of places.</p>

<h4>4.</h4>

<p>The following instance is a convincing proof of the
evil consequences of the proof-sheets not having passed
under the author's own eye. Sismondi, the celebrated
historian of France, wrote an historic tale named Julia
Severa, which was of course written in French, and it
was printed at one of the best offices in Paris; but the
author himself did not see the proofs, whence, though it
makes only two rather slender duodecimo volumes, there
are actually whole pages of <em>errata</em>! I know, by the
way, no better mode of weaning oneself from what I
shall presently describe as <em>printer-worship</em> than a habit
of examining the <em>errata</em> in books printed in the two last
centuries. Further, in good printing-offices, at least in
this country, it is the practice that the proofs, after they
come from the compositor, should be read in the office
and corrected before they are sent to the author or editor;
while, even at the present day, in the Royal printing-office
in Copenhagen there are no readers, and the
sheets are sent out just as they come from the compositor,
and what that state is must be known to any one
conversant with printing-offices. Now it is very possible,
or rather highly probable, if not certain, that such
was the case in England also in former times; and supposing
that it was the editors, and not Blount, that read
the proofs, as the wretched state of the punctuation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
might seem to indicate, we need not feel any surprise at
the very unsatisfactory state of the text of the folio of
1623. In opposition, however, to this opinion, the Cambridge
editors think that "there were no proof-sheets,
in those days, sent either to author or editor," and that
"after a MS. had been sent to press it was seen only by
the printers, and one or more correctors of the press
employed by the publishers for that purpose." But
on this hypothesis how are we to account for the
great correctness of our author's Poems, Spenser's
Shepherd's Calendar, the Works of Jonson, Drayton,
and others? The following words on the title-page
of Marston's Fawne, 2nd edition, offer decisive evidence
that authors <em>did</em> read the proof-sheets of their
works:&mdash;"Now corrected of many faults, which, by
reason of the author's absence, were let slip in the
first edition."</p>

<h4>5.</h4>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, there are editors of Shakespeare
who, rejecting the evidence of sense, grammar,
and logic, obstinately adhere to the printed text, terming
that alone <em>authority</em>, and even holding the second and
later folios to be such; and it is really pitiable to see
them superstitiously retaining for instance <em>'tis</em> or <em>it's</em>
when the metre requires <em>it is</em>, and syncopated forms as
<em>lov'd</em>, <em>own'd</em>, etc., when the verse has need of the complete
word, and <em>vice versâ</em>. These I denominate <em>Printer-worshipers</em>;
for it is in reality to the authority of the
printer, not of the poet, that they bow. The most extraordinary
instance of this propensity in existence is
the retention of "strain <em>at</em> a gnat" in our authorized
version of the New Testament, a most manifest printer's
error; for no schoolboy could have made it in translating,
and in all the previous English versions the word
is <em>out</em>. Yet there it has stood uncorrected for two centuries
and a half! Hardly inferior as a piece of printer-worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
is the following. A stanza of a song in Fletcher's
Spanish Curate (ii. 5) ends thus:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">From that breath, whose native smell</div>
<div class="i0">Indian odours far excel,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>thus expressing the very contrary of what was meant!
Theobald, a true critic, therefore most properly added
<em>doth</em>&mdash;in the wrong place, however, as it should begin
the line; yet Mr. Dyce says, "the old text is doubtless
what the poet wrote"!!</p>

<p>To conclude, then, if the printed text cannot be made
to yield sense the fault <em>must</em> lie, not with the poet, but
with the transcriber or the printer, and a correction,
made in conformity with the language and mode of
thinking of the poet and his time, as it <em>may</em> give what
he wrote, or may have written, should be admitted into
the text. I must here, <em>en passant</em>, impress it on the
reader as a maxim, that no word should be used in correction
that is not to be found in the poet himself, or
in his contemporaries.</p>

<h4>6.</h4>

<p>A printer is a transcriber or copyist, with the only
difference that he uses type instead of a pen. He looks
at the <em>copy</em>, as it is termed, and takes up the whole or
part of a sentence in his mind, and then goes on composing
or setting up the type. Meanwhile he is very
possibly engaged in conversation, or he is listening to
that of others, or he is thinking of something else. His
mind being thus distracted, errors will naturally arise in
what he is composing. Besides, he has very often to contend
with the difficulties caused by illegible writing in
the manuscript. There is another source of error&mdash;and
one in which the printer is perfectly blameless&mdash;which
I have never seen noticed. It is this, that in speaking
and reading we often slur over, elide or suppress the final
consonant if the following word begin with a consonant;
and this is not peculiar to the English, but is to be
found in the French, German, and other languages, being
in fact a law of nature, the result of our organization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
The most usual case is when, as in the following example,
the first word ends and the next begins with the same
consonant. Thus in one of the Irish Melodies of Moore,
a poet more devoted to euphony than to sense, we have</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Thou would<em>est</em> still be adored as this momen<em>t</em> thou art,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>where it will be seen that the letters in italics are not,
and cannot be pronounced, without making a pause between
the words. In another song of the same poet we
have</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Mary, I believed thee true,</div>
<div class="i0">And I was blest in thus believing.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Here, if it were not for the second line, no one, on only
hearing the first, could tell whether the word was <em>believed</em>
or <em>believe</em>; for the sound is exactly the same: see on
Much Ado, iv. 1; M. N. D. ii. 1. We surely then cannot
blame the printer who makes a mistake in such
cases, but we should not hesitate to correct it. We
should also remember that this suppression or clipping
is more frequent with the classes to which the printer
probably belonged than with the educated.</p>

<p>It is chiefly the dentals <em>t</em> and <em>d</em> that are thus suppressed
before words commencing with a mute consonant;
and it is surprising what a number of words there
are in common use that have been thus curtailed. Thus
in <em>and</em> the <em>d</em> is rarely sounded, even before vowels; <em>of</em> is
so generally pronounced <em>o'</em> that it were needless printing
it so, as is usual in the dramatists, were it not that <em>o'</em>
represents <em>on</em> as well as <em>of</em>; we all say "<em>Who</em> did you
see?" though we should write it "<em>Whom</em> did you see?"
Instances, in fine, are numberless; but we should keep
the principle constantly in mind. See the note on <em>sly-slow</em>,
Rich. II. i. 3; and on <em>by peeping</em>, Cymb. i. 7.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is sometimes a transference
of a consonant from the end of one word to the beginning
of the next, which injures the sense,&mdash;<em>ex. gr.</em>,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Thence forth descending to that perilous porch</div>
<div class="i0">Those dreadful flames she also found <em>delayed</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">F. Q. iii. 12. 42.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Here the poet probably wrote <em>allayed</em>, and the printer
transferred to it the <em>d</em> of <em>found</em>. See on Temp. iv. 1.</p>

<p>While treating of elision, it may not be useless to
remark that when a word beginning with <em>h</em> is monosyllabic,
or is not accented on its first syllable, the <em>h</em> is not
sounded. Any one who will observe will find that <em>his</em>,
for example, is usually pronounced <em>is</em>; so that there is
no occasion for the <em>'s</em> of the dramatists. So we should
write and pronounce <em>a history</em>, but write <em>an historian</em>
and pronounce <em>an 'istorian</em>; for <em>a historian</em>, as it is too
often written and pronounced, makes a most unpleasant
<em>hiatus</em>. We may observe how constantly the aspirate
is suppressed in the poetry of Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>The errors of transcribers and printers are <em>Omission</em>,
<em>Addition</em>, <em>Transposition</em>, <em>Substitution</em>. Of these I will
now give instances, chiefly from my own experience. I
must, however, previously notice the rather curious fact,
that these four sources of error, which I had traced out
in our printed works, are all, and no other, acted upon
by that, in my mind, most able of the German critics,
J. Olshausen, in that <em>chef d'&oelig;uvre</em> of criticism, his Comment
on the Book of Psalms, thus showing how universal
they are.</p>

<h4>7.</h4>

<p><em>Omission.</em>&mdash;If any one will examine a proof-sheet as
it comes from the hands of a compositor, he will find
abundant instances of this source of error. One would
think that such could hardly escape the author's eye;
and yet, in the edition of Ben Jonson's plays corrected
by himself, almost the only errors detected by the editors
have been those of omission; and a few more have, I
think, escaped <em>them</em>. I may add that the words supplied
by them seem to me to be almost invariably the very
words which had been omitted. In Notes and Queries
(3 S. vii.) there is a list of the principal <em>errata</em> in the
reprint of the First Folio, in 1808; and the far larger
portion of them are omissions which can easily be supplied.
From my own experience in the case of reprints,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
I can further assert that corrections of this kind are by
no means a matter of hap-hazard; for where I have
supplied the words I supposed lost or altered I have almost
invariably found, on referring to the original edition,
that I had hit on the exact word. As an instance,
in a late reprint of Akenside's Poems, the following line
occurs in the Hymn to the Naiads:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Your <em>sultry</em> springs, through every urn.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Here I at once corrected <em>salutary</em>, and on looking at
the original edition I found I was right. Yet, had this
correction been made in Shakespeare, we know how it
would have been disputed. As to omissions I can give
the following instances. In a reprint (Lond. 1816) of
Fletcher's Purple Island, we find (xii. 74, 85) the following
lines:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Thus with glad sorrow did she plain her.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">In th' own fair silver shines and borrow'd gold.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Each line being short, I read in the first "<em>sweetly</em> plain
her," and in the second <em>one</em> and "<em>fairer</em> borrow'd gold,"
and on looking at the original 4to I found I had supplied
the poet's very words. In Chaucer's Romaunt of
the Rose, the following line is in all the MSS. and editions,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">She hadde a gay mirrour,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>which is evidently a foot short. I read 'She had <em>in
hand</em>,' and on looking at the original I found <em>en sa main</em>.</p>

<p>It is not often that proofs have been read more carefully
than were those of my edition of Milton's Poems,
both by myself and by others; and yet, in the reprint of
the text, in one place (Par. Lost, x. 422) it will be found
that the word <em>to</em> is missing, thus destroying the metre;
and yet none of us perceived it.</p>

<p>A far stronger case is the following. Never apparently
was a work edited with greater care than Mr.
Panizzi's edition of Bojardo and Ariosto; and yet in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Orlando Innamorato, II. xxiv. 54, the concluding couplet
of the stanza is printed thus:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Persa ho mia gioia, e'l mio bel Paradiso,</div>
<div class="i0">Per lui che tardo giunse a darmi.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Here a reader, who has even but the slightest knowledge
of Italian, will see at once that the word <em>avviso</em> has been
omitted at the end of the second line; and yet this
escaped not merely the printer's reader, who, even if
ignorant of the language, might be supposed to have
missed the rime, but the lynx-eyed editor himself, not
only in the proof, but in the fair sheets which he was
evidently in the habit of examining most carefully. The
more I think of this error the more I feel astonished at
its occurrence, a thing for which I cannot in any manner
account; the following, however, is nearly a parallel.
In a most carefully edited Greek Testament (Lond. 1837),
in 1 Cor. xi. 23, three important words are omitted!
Need we, then, wonder at omissions in Shakespeare?</p>

<p>The omission is generally, as in these cases, of single
words, from noun to interjection, all parts of speech included,
and also of single letters or syllables. It is
rather curious, too, that when a word has been repeated
by the poet it is sometimes omitted by the printer.
Thus "What wheels? what racks? what fires?" W. T.
iii. 2, is printed, "What wheels? racks? fires?"
There is another instance in the same play, and many
in the other plays. In Chaucer the instances are numerous.
Addresses, as <em>sir</em>, <em>my lord</em>, etc., are sometimes left
out, as also are <em>pray</em>, <em>now</em>, <em>only</em>, and others which are
not absolutely necessary for the sense&mdash;and even two or
more words; in all which cases the omission is indicated
by the defect of metre. This the reader will do well to
keep constantly in mind. For an example see on Tam.
of Shrew, i. 1. It is surprising how often the negative
particle is wanting in these plays of Shakespeare's. I
have discovered its absence in between twenty and thirty
places, not one-half of which had been observed by preceding
editors. But not merely single words have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
left out by printers; want of rime or want of connexion
shows that entire lines have been omitted. Mr. Collier
observes that three lines are wanting in various places
of the Variorum Shakespeare; and such being the case
in the present century, we need not wonder at so many
having been passed over by the original printers. The
reader will find about two dozen such cases noticed in
my Edition and in the following pages, not one-half of
which had been observed by preceding editors. Shakespeare
himself furnishes the following remarkable instance.
In Com. of Err. ii. 2, the three last folios omit
the two lines beginning with "Wear gold and no man,"
etc. Nares gives in his Glossary (<em>v.</em> Portingall) a curious
instance of the omission of a line, which escaped the
author's own notice in the proof-sheet. So also in Massinger's
Unnatural Combat, lines are wanting in two
places, though he himself must have read the proofs. In
2 Hen. VI. iv. 1, there is a line wanting in the folio, to
recover which we are actually obliged to go to the original
play of The Contention, etc.</p>

<p>Parts of lines, generally the latter part, are also often
wanting, but not so often as it may seem; for short lines,
and also over-long lines, generally are caused by malarrangement
of the text. The main cause, however, of
these losses is the ill-usage to which the manuscripts
seem to have been subjected in the part of the theatre
in which they were kept, and the careless treatment of
them by those who had occasion to use them. Hence
in some places the writing may have been obliterated by
ink-blots, in others effaced by friction, or by damp or
dust; while sometimes a part of a leaf may have been
torn away. We must remember that a large number of
Shakespeare's plays were lying thus exposed to ill-usage,
probably in the property-room of the Globe or Blackfriars,
for a space of from twenty to thirty years.</p>

<p>The parts most likely to have thus sustained injury
must have been those nearest the edges of the page; and
hence the part effaced would be the beginning of the
line or the end of it; and as the lines run evenly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the beginning, while they are of irregular length, the
effacement at the beginning would be in general of mere
monosyllables, as <em>I</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>with</em>, <em>and</em>, &amp;c., while that at the
end might be of several words, at times even of half a
line. In the beginning, too&mdash;as will be seen in the notes
on Merchant of Venice, iv. 1, As You Like It, ii. 7, and
elsewhere&mdash;more than one word has been sometimes
effaced. In the case of entire lines or large parts of
lines, the cause may have been their position at the top
or bottom of the page, and their consequent proximity
to the edge.</p>

<p>It is rather strange that I should have been&mdash;as I
believe I am&mdash;the first to notice this very simple and
natural mode of accounting for the losses in the text.
The number of these losses which I have, or seem to
have, detected in the beginnings is over seventy, those
at the ends more than double that number. As they
are all supplied in my Edition, and noted in the following
pages, the reader will have ample occasion for ascertaining
whether my theory is correct or not. I will
here, however, give a couple of instances.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">1 Hen. IV. iii. 1.</p>

<p>Here the critics are perplexed with "wilful-blame,"
which is a compound without example; but let us suppose
that the poet wrote "wilful-blameable," and that
the final letters had been effaced, we get a compound
term of which examples are numerous. The other is,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And made him stoop to the water. 'Tis wonder<em>ful</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Cymb. iv. 2.</p>

<p>In the following pages it will be seen that occasionally
I attempt to supply the losses of lines and parts of
lines. It will not, I hope, be supposed that I am so
presumptuous as to expect my productions to be admitted
into the text. My object has merely been, by showing
how easily and naturally something could be supplied,
to make the reader see more clearly that something had
been lost. In three places, however (All's Well, i. 1,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Tr. &amp; Cr. ii. 1, Cor. ii. 3), I have ventured to place
them in the text of my Edition.</p>

<p>I must, in fine, request the reader most earnestly not
to pooh-pooh this principle of effacement, but to keep it
steadily in mind in reading the other dramatists, as well
as Shakespeare; for he will find it a most valuable aid.
Among the instances of effacement at the end is to be
noted that of compound words of which the last part has
been lost. In five places I have thought myself justified in
supplying the missing word, namely, Winter's Tale, i. 2,
Rich. III. v. 3, Ham. iii. 4, Tim. i. 2, ii. 2; for it is
almost only at the end of a line that we ever find reason
to suspect this kind of effacement.</p>

<p>In editing the Plays, the additions made to the text
should always be marked, so as not to mislead the reader.
In <em>my</em> edition, and in this volume, they are always
printed in italics.</p>

<h4>8.</h4>

<p><em>Addition.</em>&mdash;Of this also we meet with instances; but,
as might naturally be expected, they are not so numerous
as those of omission. In the following pages I place
between brackets such words as I regard as additions
made by the compositor or transcriber. As proofs of such
additions being made I give the following, from the reprint
of the text in my own edition of Milton's Poems.</p>
<div class="center">

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And out of sight escaped at the least;</div>
<div class="i0">Yet not [of sight] escaped from the due reward</div>

</div></div></div>
<p class="right">F. Q. iii. 5. 14.</p>

<p>So it is printed in the edition of 1750.</p>

<p>I may here add that printers have a wonderful propensity
to add or omit&mdash;the former much more frequently&mdash;the
letter s at the end of words. I remember having
one time had to strike out in a single page no less than
five of these ss thus liberally bestowed upon me. So
also&mdash;but whether owing to the poet or the printer is
dubious&mdash;we meet in Shakespeare with <em>whom</em> used as a
nominative. See on Winter's Tale, v. 3, <em>ad fin.</em> In
making corrections relating to these finals, our only
guides therefore must be grammar, logic, and poetic
melody.</p>

<h4>9.</h4>

<p><em>Transposition.</em>&mdash;Of all modes of restoring the melody,
and at times the sense, of verses this is perhaps the most
legitimate and the most certain. I have therefore had
recourse to it without scruple; and it will be seen that
in my Edition and in this volume I have thus restored
the sense or the melody of about sixty lines, of which
not quite a fourth had attracted the attention of preceding
editors. In my Life of Milton (p. 286) will be
found a very curious instance of transposition and omission
combined in the poet's own reprint of Comus, neither
of which he notices, though he made two corrections
in one of the lines.</p>

<p>In Chaucer's Romaunt of the Rose, the transpositions
in the latter part are so numerous that it was necessary
to have recourse to the original poem for the proper arrangement;
and I suspect that this source of error will
be found in most languages. Mr. Brandreth, in his very
curious and interesting edition of the Ilias, has made
many transpositions, and they are well deserving of attention.
His note on Il. i. 18, is "Verborum transpositio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
tutissimum remedium est, cum saltem, quoad grammaticam,
ita dixisse potuerit poeta. Recitatores sæpe
verba retinent, dum ordinem obliviscuntur." This most
exactly accords with what we find in Shakespeare. I
think also that many might be, as some have been, made
in the poetic and prophetic books of the Old Testament&mdash;<em>ex.
gr.</em>,</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i0">"Ye mountains of Gilboa, no dew nor no rain be upon you,
and fields of offerings; for there" &amp;c.&mdash;2 Sam. i. 21.</div>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Now surely the royal poet must have written,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Ye mountains of Gilboa, and fields of offering!</div>
<div class="i0">No dew and no rain be upon you:</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>and it appears still more certain when we look at the
original Hebrew.</p>

<p>A chief cause of errors of this kind seems to have
been the addition, by the author, of one or more lines to
a place which he had previously deemed complete, and
this addition, having been made in the margin, was taken
in by the printer in the wrong place; as such I regard
the transposition in M. N. D. ii. 1. Another cause was
the omission of something by a transcriber, who, when
he detected his error, wrote what he had left out in the
margin, and the next transcriber or the printer carelessly
inserted it in the wrong place. Of this we have
very striking instances in the Chorus to Hen. V. ii., 2 Hen.
VI. iii. 1, and Rom. &amp; Jul. iii. 3. As in these cases, entire
lines or even couplets get out of place, sometimes
parts of lines (King John, iii. 3, Rich. II. v. 3), at other
times single words. Thus adjectives change places
(Temp. i. 1. iv. 1), and substantives do the same (All's
Well, ii. 3, M. N. D. ii. 1, L. L. L. iv. 3). The following
is a notable instance. In Massinger's Maid of
Honour (i. 1), a play of which the proofs were probably
read by the poet himself, we read, "A gentleman
and yet no lord," where the context shows that the very
opposite is meant. Gifford saw this, but he did not see
the cause, namely, that <em>a</em> and <em>no</em> had changed places in
the printer's mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
I have remarked several errors of this kind in Chaucer,
in whom, in fact, they are most numerous&mdash;<em>ex. gr.</em>,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And eke in his hert had compassioun.</div>
<div class="i0"><em>And in his hert eke had compassioun.</em></div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And pitous and just and alway y-liche.</div>
<div class="i0"><em>And just and pitous and alway y-liche.</em></div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">That it was a blissful noise to here.</div>
<div class="i0"><em>That it a blissful noise was to here.</em></div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>In the Faerie Queene, we have</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Was like enchantment, that through both his <em>eyes</em></div>
<div class="i0">And both his <em>ears</em>, did steal his heart away.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">vi. 2. 3.</p>

<p>Here, as the riming line ends in <em>appears</em>, we must
transpose "eyes" and "ears." Again, in all editions of
Parnell's poems, from the first (edited by Pope), we read
in the Hermit,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Then with the sun a rising journey went,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>where both the context and common sense show that
"rising" properly belongs to "sun." The original printer,
however, joined it with "journey," and he has been, of
course, duteously followed by his successors, while editors
never seem to have discerned the incongruity.</p>

<p>In the edition of Akenside above mentioned, I met
with</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Of triangle or circle, cube or cone,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>where it is quite plain that the two first substantives
had changed places in the printer's mind.</p>

<p>Surely Wordsworth did not write</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I did not hunt after nor greatly prize.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Prelude, ed. 1858.</p>

<p>In a proof-sheet of my Edition, I found</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And leave your brother speed to gos elsewhere.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">3 Hen. VI. iv. 1.</p>

<p>In Troilus and Cressida, v. 2, there is a passage to
which transposition, and it alone, gives sense. It is
difficult to see how the printer could have made such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
jumble; and yet it is manifest that he must have done so.
There is, however, as I have shown in my note on the
place, just such another in the play of The Two Noble
Kinsmen, which the editors have made no attempt at
correcting. In the following passage of Chaucer,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Tooke my horse and forthe I went,</div>
<div class="i0">Oute of my chaumbre; I never stent.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Book of the Duchesse.</p>

<p>I would read</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Oute of my chaumbre forthe I went,</div>
<div class="i0">And tooke my hors; I never stent.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>In the same poet's Romaunt of the Rose, we have the
following passage, unnoticed by any editor,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Thine armys shalt thou sprede abrode</div>
<div class="i0">As man in warre were forweriede,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>where in the first line we should read "abrode sprede,"
and in the second reject "were" as an addition of the
copyist. An exactly similar transposition occurs in a
later part of that poem.</p>

<h4>10.</h4>

<p><em>Substitution.</em>&mdash;"He who has not repeatedly observed
how a copyist, from inattention, sets down a word which
his mind has presented to him instead of that which is
before his eyes, must have seen little of copies of print
or manuscript." These are the words of a Spanish writer,
and they are of universal application. I remember
myself once, with Herodotus before my eyes, writing
<em>Sestos</em> for <em>Abydos</em>; and the changes I have made in copying
passages for this work have amazed me. In Corneille's
play of Rodogune (i. 1), we read <em>enlever</em> where
the proper word is <em>élever</em>, and Voltaire justly suspected
that it was an error of the original printer. Further on
the reader will meet with a similar error in the original
edition of Tasso's Gerusalemme.</p>

<p>The most ordinary case of substitution seems to be
that of synonyms; at least there is none to which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
have been so subject myself. In giving examples I will
commence with Spenser.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A yearly solemn feast she wonts to <em>make</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">F. Q. ii. 2. 42.</p>

<p>Now, as the rimes are <em>hold</em>, <em>told</em>, the poet must have
written, or have intended to write, <em>hold</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">That doth against the dead his hand uprear.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Ib. ii. 8. 29.</p>

<p>Here the word must have been <em>upheave</em>, the rimes being
<em>leave</em>, <em>cleave</em>, <em>bereave</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">When walking through the garden them she <em>spied</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Ib. iii. 6. 40.</p>

<p>As the rimes are <em>law</em>, <em>draw</em>, we must of course read
<em>saw</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Of finest gold. The fifth game was a great new standing <em>bowl</em>,</div>
<div class="i0">To set down both ways. These brought in, Achilles then stood up.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Chapman, Iliads, xxiii. 249.</p>

<p>The right word, it is quite plain, is <span class="err" title="original: c p"><em>cup</em></span>.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Or painful to his slumbers; easy, <em>sweet</em>,</div>
<div class="i0">And as a purling stream, thou son of Night.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Fletch. Valentinian, v. 2.</p>

<p>Here, as it has been shown, the proper word is <em>light</em>;
yet Mr. Dyce has not ventured to receive it.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Mi si scoperse; onde mi nacque un <em>ghiaccio</em></div>
<div class="i0">Nel core, ed evvi ancora,</div>
<div class="i0">E sarà sempre, fin ch'io le sia in braccio.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>My late friend Rossetti, in copying out this passage of
Petrarca in his Amor Platonico, etc., wrote <em>gelo</em> for
<em>ghiaccio</em>, and never saw the error, even in reading the
proof; and so it is printed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the adjacent or riming lines sometimes
terminate in the same word. There are many
instances in Shakespeare, and I have met with the following
in Italian.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
<div class="i0">Ciascun de' cavalieri ebbe <em>e sergenti</em></div>
<div class="i0">Ed al servizio suo donne <em>e sergenti</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">B. Tasso, Amadigi, xxii. 67.</p>

<p>where, as the rimes show, the first line should end with
<em>una stanza</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Bears in his boasted fan an Iris <em>bright</em>,</div>
<div class="i0">When her discoloured bow she spreads through heaven <em>bright</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">F. Q. iii. 11. 47.</p>

<p>We meet also with places where the sense or the
metre, unaided by rime, must be our guide in correcting&mdash;<em>ex.
gr.</em>,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The round earth, heaven's great queen and Pallas to whose bands.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Chapman, Iliads, i. 395.</p>

<p>Here the metre shows that the right word is <em>Minerva</em>,
not <em>Pallas</em>.</p>

<p>There is one most remarkable case of substitution to
which sufficient attention has never been given by the
critics. It may be termed <em>reaction</em> or <em>repetition</em>, and
arises from the impression made by some particular
word on the mind of the transcriber or printer, or even
of the writer himself.</p>

<p>Thus in a proof-sheet of my Milton I found</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A <em>furnace</em> horrible on all sides round,</div>
<div class="i0">As one great furnace flamed.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Par. Lost, i. 61.</p>

<p>while the word before the compositor's eyes was <em>dungeon</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">To me <em>most</em> fatal, me most it concerns.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Par. Reg. iv. 205: Todd's 4th edit.</p>

<p>Here, again, the true reading is <em>so</em>; yet, as <em>most</em> makes
good sense, if the error had been in the original edition
it would in all probability never have been detected.
Opening by chance Bloomfield's pretty poem of The
Farmer's Boy (ed. 1857), I met with</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Till when up-hill the destined <em>hill</em> he gains.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Winter, 173.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
We may find in Chaucer&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">What ladies fairest ben or best <em>dauncing</em>,</div>
<div class="i0">Or which of hem can <em>daunce</em> best or sing.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Knt's Tale.</p>

<p>Here for <em>dauncing</em> we should probably read <em>loking</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Of his <em>gladnesse</em> he <em>gladed</em> her anone.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Tr. and Cr. i.</p>

<p>The poet probably wrote <em>goodnesse</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">For though a man <em>forbide</em> drunkenesse,</div>
<div class="i0">He not <em>forbides</em> that every creature</div>
<div class="i0">Be drunkeles for alway, as I gesse.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Ib. ii.</p>

<p>We should read <em>commaundes</em> in the second line.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Witness the daily libels <em>almost</em> ballads</div>
<div class="i0">In every place, <em>almost</em> in every province,</div>
<div class="i0">Are made upon your lust.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Thierry and Theodoret, i. 1.</p>

<p>We should for the first <em>almost</em>, which must be wrong,
probably read <em>and the</em>. Mr. Dyce seems never to have
seen this; for he had no conception of this source of
error: yet I wonder common sense did not suggest that
something must be wrong.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The things that grievous were to do or bear</div>
<div class="i0">Them to renew, I wote, breeds no delight;</div>
<div class="i0">Best music breeds <em>delight</em> in loathing ear.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">F. Q. i. 8. 44.</p>

<p>For <em>delight</em> in the last line we might read <em>dislike</em>,
but I think we should rather read <em>annoy</em>; for in these
cases, as we may see, no resemblance in form or sound
is to be sought. I therefore in Othel. iii. 3, reject the emendation
of Pope and 4to 1630 of <em>feels</em> for <em>keeps</em>, because
it was evidently suggested by the slight similarity of
form, and does not perfectly suit the context. The reader
will find an excellent instance in As You Like It, ii. 3.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">My news shall be the <em>news</em> to that great feast.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Ham. ii. 2.</p>

<p>So the folio reads; the 4to has more correctly <em>fruit</em>.</p>

<p>Surely Shakespeare never wrote</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">To seek thy <em>help</em>, by beneficial <em>help</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Com. of Err. i. 1.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">He that they cannot <em>help</em> him,</div>
<div class="i0">They that they cannot <em>help</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">All's Well, i. 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
As this error <em>never</em> occurs in Jonson and Massinger,
and only, I believe, in the instance given above in
Beaumont and Fletcher, and has no æsthetic advantage
or beauty to recommend it, it seems quite absurd to
suppose that Shakespeare, whose vocabulary was the
largest of all, and whose ear was so fine and correct,
should have found pleasure in it. Surely a just critic
will sooner lay the blame on the printer and the careless
editors, very different in this respect from those of
Beaumont and Fletcher, who seem never to have hesitated
to correct an error when they discovered it.</p>

<p>The resemblance in form above alluded to is of great
importance, under the name of <em>ductus literarum</em>, in the
eyes of Mr. Dyce, and it should always be attended to;
for it is usually caused by the attempt of the printer to
make out illegible writing. The following are striking
instances:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Peele's Edward I. these lines occur.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">To calm, to qualify, and to compound,</div>
<div class="i0"><em>Thank England's</em> strife of Scotland's climbing peers.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>That the last line is nonsense was clear to every one;
but no critic ever could emend it. The true reading,
however, is doubtless <em>The enkindled</em>, which flashed suddenly
on my mind one time when I was considering the
passage. It was probably the resemblance of sound
chiefly that misled the printer.</p>

<p>At the end of Marston's Insatiate Countess we meet
the following unmeaning line,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Like <em>Missermis</em> cheating of the <em>brack</em>,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>which Steevens corrected most happily thus&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Like <em>Mycerinus</em> cheating of the <em>oracle</em>,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>having discerned the allusion to Herod. ii. 133.</p>

<p>It is very curious that the word substituted is often the
very opposite of the right word. I myself once wrote&mdash;and
so it is printed&mdash;<em>diameter</em> for <em>circumference</em>. In Mrs.
C. Clarke's most valuable Concordance we have "humorous
<em>plebeian</em>" for "humorous <em>patrician</em>." I have met with
<em>next</em> for <em>last</em> and <em>none</em> for <em>some</em>; so in The Mer. of Ven., ii. 2,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
where the folio has "Is sum of <em>no</em>thing," the 4tos read
"Is sum of <em>some</em>thing." In Lear v. 3, the folio reads</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The gods are just, and of our pleasant <em>vices</em></div>
<div class="i0">Make instruments to plague us;</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>while the 4tos have "pleasant <em>virtues</em>."</p>

<p>In All's Well, iii. 2, and Taming of the Shrew, iii. 1,
we have <em>old</em> for <em>new</em>. In a proof-sheet which I lately
saw there was a quotation of</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The paths of glory lead but to the grave;</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>and the printer had substituted <em>life</em> for "grave," though,
as the entire stanza was given, he had the rime to guide
him. Many instances of this practice will be found in
Love's Labour's Lost. In La Giovanezza, a poem of
the Italian poet Pindemonte, I have just met with <em>brutte</em>
where the rime and the sense require <em>belle</em>.</p>

<p>It does not seem to have been observed that printers
will actually insert words, for the sake of sense or metre,
when they have made a mistake. In my Life of Milton,
I had occasion to quote a passage from his prose
works containing "with a conscience that would <em>retch</em>;"
and of this the printer made "with a conscience that <em>he</em>
would <em>relish</em>;" and so, I am sorry to say, it is printed.
See on Mer. of Ven. iv. 1.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And stones did cast, yet he for nought would swerve.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">F. Q. v. 12. 43.</p>

<p>As the rimes are <em>deserved</em>, <em>preserved</em>, <em>observed</em>, the poet
must have written <em>e'er swerved</em> or <em>nothing swerved</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">In her right hand a fire-brand she <em>did toss</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">F. Q. iii. 12, 17.</p>

<p>The rimes are <em>embost</em>, <em>lost</em>, so that Spenser must have
written <em>tost</em>, making, as usual, a dissyllable of <em>fire</em>.
That it was not the poet himself that made the mistake
is clear; for in</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Till Arthur all that reckoning defrayed (ii. 10, 49)</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>the edition of 1750 has <em>did defray</em>.</p>

<p>A contrary error to this is where the printer has made
one word of two, caused either by sound or by illegible
writing. For instances, see on Com. of Err. iii. 1, Tw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Night, i. 1, Mer. Wives, v. 5, Ant. and Cleop. iv. 9, Macb.
iii. 4.</p>

<p>The fact of effacement in the manuscript, on which
I have laid such stress in the section on <em>Omission</em>, has
also been a cause of substitution; for, the original
word having become nearly or totally illegible, the
transcriber or compositor, in order to make sense, used
to give some term of his own. Thus we have <em>yes</em> for
<em>I will</em>, Meas. for Meas. iii. 1, <em>yea</em> for <em>even so</em>, Rich. II.
iii. 1, <em>ay</em> for <em>I will</em>, Ham. iv. 7, as is proved by the metre.
These are all at the beginning of the line, and hence their
liability to effacement. See also on All's Well, ii. 1,
Twelfth Night, iv. 3, Rich. II. i. 3, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Finally, substitutions are often quite capricious, making
no sense whatever. For "he went circuit," where
my manuscript was perfectly legible, I once got "<em>the
local</em> circuit;" so also "<em>the merits</em>" for "there an
echo;" "<em>establishment</em>" for "established government."
In Alison's Life of Lord Castlereagh, one of the pall-bearers
at the funeral of the Duke of Wellington was Sir
Peregrine <em>Pickle</em> (Maitland); in all editions of Joseph
Andrews we have in one place "Sir <em>John</em>" for "Sir
Thomas" Booby.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that <em>to unto</em>, <em>till until</em>, <em>on upon</em>,
<em>though although</em>, <em>e'er ever</em>, &amp;c., were frequently confounded.
It is therefore the merest printer-worship
to hesitate at altering them when the metre requires
it. A further observation is, that even down into
the eighteenth century, it was the custom to write <em>y</em>
for <em>th</em> in monosyllables beginning with this last (þ, A. S.),
as y<sup>e</sup> the, y<sup>n</sup> then, y<sup>t</sup> that, y<sup>u</sup> thou; y<sup>r</sup> your was another
abridgment; and hence confusion has often arisen. In
these plays we have <em>that</em> for <em>then</em> in four places (see on
Tr. and Cr. i. 2); and in Paradise Regained (i. 137) we
have <em>then</em> for <em>thou</em>, and also, I think, in Tw. Night, v. 1.</p>

<h4>11.</h4>

<p>Such, then, are the various sources of error in the
original editions of Shakespeare's plays, the correction
of which and restoration of the poet's real sense are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
as I have said, the task of the genuine critic, and one
in which, except in a very few instances, success is not
to be by any means despaired of.</p>

<p>As a means of obtaining it, I would, as I have done,
lay it down as a rule that no word or phrase should be
employed in restoration which is not to be found in the
poet's own works, or at least in those of his contemporaries.
It is obvious that by so doing we shall
greatly diminish the risk of failure. It is a curious
fact, that not unfrequently two or even three corrections
are so equally good, that it is exceedingly difficult
to choose between them, and that the final choice
thus becomes a matter of mere chance. In such cases
I think the critic should select the one which is the
most poetic and most worthy of the poet. The coincidence
of two or more independent critics in a correction
is, in general, a proof of its truth; yet even this is
not infallible. See on Merry Wives, ii. 3.</p>

<p>For correction, then, the first requisite is a thorough
knowledge of the poet's language, the acquisition of
which is a work demanding both time and close attention.
Shakespeare's vocabulary, as we have seen, is
extremely copious, and from his not having had the
advantage of a regular education his plays present more
anomalies, and offer more difficulties to the modern
reader than those of the contemporary dramatists.</p>

<p>In his early pieces there is an incessant play on
words; and in his later the language is often very
elliptical and the sentences greatly involved. These
difficulties are enhanced by the ignorance of punctuation,
or neglect of it, with which the editors are chargeable.
Thus it is only in very plain cases that they
notice the break in sense caused by the aposiopesis,
the anacoluthon, or an interruption, of which the reader
will find so many examples in my Edition and in
the following pages, marked for the first time, and
designated by the sign (...). I would particularly
direct his attention to Temp. iii. 1, 2 Hen. IV. iv. 1,
Ham. i. 2, i. 4.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
12.</h4>

<p>In the dramas and other works of those days we may
observe the following peculiarities.</p>

<p>The infinitive mood is used with or without <em>to</em> differently
from the present usage&mdash;prefixed where we omit,
omitted where we prefix. It is also employed, like the
Hebrew infinitive absolute, where we use the present
participle active, sometimes with a preposition, <em>ex. gr.</em>,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Copious in words, and one that much time spent</div>
<div class="i0"><em>To jest</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Lydgate, Book of Troy.</p>

<p>Even in Cowley we meet with</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The sun himself, although all eye he be,</div>
<div class="i0">Can find in love more pleasure than <em>to see</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">The Gazers.</p>

<p>Here it is plain we should use the participle <em>in seeing</em>.</p>

<p>In "He is grown too proud to be so valiant," Cor. i. l,
"to be" seems to be <em>i. q.</em> being; <em>too</em> being apparently
used in the sense of <em>trop</em>, Fr., <em>i.e.</em> excessively.</p>

<p>The passive participle was continually used in the
place of the present or past participle active or of the
future. Chapman, for instance, is profuse in his use of
it in his Homer. Of this, as of the former, we have
some remains among us still, but few indeed compared
with what our forefathers had. The perfect was also
frequently used as a part. past, and of this also we have
still some remains.</p>

<p>In imitation of the Latin and French, the writers of
the sixteenth century&mdash;for we do not meet with it in
Chaucer or Gower&mdash;used the verb as a noun, as <em>dispose</em>
for <em>disposal</em>, <em>suspect</em> for <em>suspicion</em>.</p>

<p>A further peculiarity was the use of what grammarians
call collectives, <em>i.e.</em>, the singular noun used for the plural.
We still retain this in <em>sheep</em>, <em>swine</em>, <em>fowl</em>, and partially
in <em>year</em>, <em>day</em>; but in our older writers we meet with it
in <em>horse</em> (Much Ado, i. 1, Hen. V. iv. 1, and in Chapman's
Homer continually), <em>pearl</em> (Macb. <em>ad fin.</em>), <em>tree</em>,
<em>corpse</em>, <em>witness</em>, <em>business</em>, <em>subject</em>, <em>princess</em> (Temp. i. 2),
and other words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>

Writers of those days&mdash;and Shakespeare more than
any&mdash;were fond of using verbs in a causative sense, as
<em>fall</em> for cause to fall, let fall, <em>fear</em> for make fear. In
these plays we meet, in a causative sense, with <em>cease</em>,
<em>linger</em>, <em>neglect</em>, <em>silence</em>, <em>faint</em>, <em>perish</em>, &amp;c. Thus <em>learn</em>
became <em>teach</em>, <em>take give</em>. It is only thus that "<em>smiles</em>
his cheek in years" (L. L. L. v. 2) becomes sense.</p>

<h4>13.</h4>

<p>There was a peculiarity of the grammar of those days
which is now confined to the vulgar, namely, that of
joining a plural nominative with a singular verb,
<em>ex. gr.</em>,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">That in this spleen ridiculous <em>appears</em>,</div>
<div class="i0">To check their folly, passions solemn <em>tears</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">L. L. L. v. 2.</p>

<p>The rimes here and in several other places prove
that this is no printer's error; and this construction is
actually most frequent in Peele, Marston, and Fletcher&mdash;all
University men! Editors, Mr. Dyce for example,
are in the habit of taking the most unwarrantable
liberty of altering this construction, except where restrained
by the rimes. This practice is highly reprehensible
and should be avoided; for we should give the
text as it came from the poet's pen.</p>

<p>The origin of this structure is very simple. In
the Anglo-Saxon the verbs made their plural in <em>th</em>,
not in <span class="err" title="read: s"><em>n</em></span>, as afterwards became the usage. This plural
of the verb occurs continually in the Vision of Piers
Ploughman, and we find it not unfrequently even in the
State Papers of the early Tudor period, in its later
form; for, as in the singular, the <em>th</em> was gradually
changed to <em>s</em>.</p>

<p>In the more artistic compositions of Chaucer and
Gower, however, it is very rare. The following line
in Chaucer,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">As <em>flakès fallès</em> in grete snowes,</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">House of Fame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
shows that even in his time the <em>th</em> had been converted
into <em>s</em>. The present practice, then, we may see is merely
a change of fashion, and our ancestors' mode of forming
the plural was perfectly correct and grammatical, with
one exception&mdash;of which we still meet instances&mdash;that
of using <em>is</em> and <em>was</em> as a plural. In my Edition of our
poet's plays, I have therefore very generally preserved
this structure; for we may alter orthography and punctuation,
but not grammar.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I must maintain, in opposition to
Mr. Dyce, that the union of a single noun with a plural
verb was <em>never</em> a rule of the language, but <em>always</em> an
error of the copyist, or a slip of the writer. Of this
I can give positive instances.</p>

<p>I one day met in my own History of England the
following words, "The <em>blood</em> of Catesby and two others
alone <em>were</em> shed;" and on looking at the first edition I
found of course that my word had been <em>was</em>. In Mr.
Lloyd's Critical Remarks on Measure for Measure, in
Singer's Shakespeare, we may read "the five <em>acts</em> of the
first part of Promos and Cassandra <em>concludes</em> the iniquity
of the deputy." Nor is this confined to English;
in the Gerusalemme Liberata, and unnoticed by any
editor, we find</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Non si conviene a te, cui fatto <em>il corso</em></div>
<div class="i0">Delle cose e de' tempi <em>han</em> si prudente.&mdash;x. 41.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>In all cases it will be found to be the consequence of a
noun of a different number having intervened between
the nominative and the verb. Mr. Dyce, however, tries
to make a rule of it by saying that "our early writers"
did it when a genitive plural intervened; but that will
not apply to passages like these&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Whose <em>youth</em>, like wanton boys through bonfires,</div>
<div class="i0"><em>Have</em> skipt thy flame.&mdash;Two Noble Kinsmen, v. 1.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i14"><em>The sea</em>,</div>
<div class="i0">With his proud mountain-waters envying heaven,</div>

<div class="i0">To critic and to flatterer stopped <em>are</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="right">Shakespeare, Son. cxii.</p>

<p>This last is the error of the poet, who probably had <em>ears</em>
in his mind; yet <em>sense</em> may be a collective: all the
others are perhaps to be ascribed to the original printers.</p>

<p>The intensive particle <em>be</em> was prefixed to verbs much
more frequently than at present. There was also a frequent
ellipsis of the first personal pronoun before such
verbs as <em>cry</em>, <em>beseech</em>, <em>beshrew</em>, &amp;c.; and finally the
habit&mdash;still retained by the vulgar&mdash;of cutting away
the first syllable of a word prevailed to some extent.</p>

<h4>14.</h4>

<p>The pronunciation of Shakespeare's time of course
differed in many points from that of the present day.
Thus <em>aspect</em> and many other words were accented, and
properly, on the last syllable; we also have <em>obdúrate</em>,
<em>árchbishop</em>, <em>cónfessor</em>, &amp;c. In words such as <em>case</em>, <em>pace</em>,
<em>lace</em>, the French sound of the <em>a</em> seems to have been partially
retained&mdash;Chaucer writes these words <em>cas</em>, <em>caas</em>,
<em>paas</em>, <em>laas</em>&mdash;along with the ordinary English sound.
Chaucer also writes 'made' <em>maad</em>, Raleigh 'safe'
<em>sauf</em>; and as the Master of the Revels wrote Shakespeare's
name <em>Shaxberd</em>, we may suppose that <em>shake</em>
and terms of a similar form were pronounced <em>shak</em>, &amp;c.
If we do not pronounce <em>lac'd</em> as <em>last</em> in "lac'd mutton"
(Two Gent. i. 2), we lose the humour of the passage.
When Spenser therefore makes <em>prepar'd</em>, for example,
rime with <em>hard</em>, he was probably doing nothing very unusual;
for these double sounds&mdash;as we may see by the
example of <em>shew show</em>, <em>shrew shrow</em>, <em>lese lose</em>&mdash;were by
no means uncommon. I suspect that <em>sea</em> may have
been one of these, and that besides riming with <em>see</em>,
as indeed Chaucer always writes it, it retained the
sound of the Anglo-Saxon &#636;æ; for F. Beaumont in
his Poems almost invariably makes it rime with
such words as <em>day</em>, <em>lay</em>, <em>ray</em>. Waller, followed by Pope,
Gay, and other poets, most improperly made <em>ea</em> rime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
with <em>ai</em>, <em>ay</em>, as <em>tea</em> with <em>obey</em>, &amp;c. As <em>haste</em>, <em>chaste</em>, <em>waist</em>,
&amp;c., constantly rime with <em>fast</em>, <em>last</em>, &amp;c., they were
probably, I think certainly, pronounced as they were
written, like them; or they may have had a double pronunciation
like the words just quoted. As the more usual
orthography was <em>chaunge</em>, <em>raunge</em>, &amp;c., these words
would seem to have been pronounced as in French,
and as we still pronounce <em>daunt</em>, <em>haunt</em>, <em>avaunt</em>. In
words chiefly from the French, terminating in <em>ci</em>, <em>si</em>,
<em>ti</em> followed by a vowel, as in <em>nation</em>, <em>fashion</em>, <em>passion</em>,
&amp;c.&mdash;to which we may add <em>ocean</em>&mdash;the usual sound
was <em>s</em>, not <em>sh</em> as at present. On the whole, the language
seems to have been more euphonious than that of
the present day.</p>

<p>While on the subject of euphony, I must direct attention
to one point. Our ancestors probably pronounced
<em>my</em>, <em>thy</em> (mín, þín, A.-S.), <em>mee</em>, <em>thee</em>, with a short sound
also, when not emphatic, as in <em>by</em>, <em>to</em>, &amp;c. Owing to its
falling out of familiar use, and its employment in the
Bible and Liturgy, <em>thy</em> has long&mdash;except by the Quakers
and the peasantry&mdash;been pronounced so as to rime
with <em>fly</em>, <em>try</em>; but <em>my</em> retained its proper sound till
within the last few years; Walker, for instance,
knew nothing of a change. But now our ears are
constantly dinned with an egotistic <em>my</em> like <em>thy</em>. I
mention this because this new-fangled pronunciation
is ruinous to both euphony and humour in our elder
writers.</p>

<p>I shall conclude with some remarks upon <em>its</em>, a word
of which Shakespeare may almost be regarded as the
originator; though Spenser, no doubt, had used it <em>once</em>
(F. Q. vi. 11. 34) before him. Singer says it "occurs
but twice or thrice" in Shakespeare; and Archbishop
Trench and others say "three or four times;" while
the fact is that its occurs <em>twelve</em>, and <em>it</em>, as a genitive,
no less than <em>fifteen</em> times. We meet <em>its</em> only nine times
in the numerous plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, and
but half a dozen times in those of Jonson or Massinger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>

The Chinese language makes the genitive by merely
prefixing the substantive; thus <em>houe jin</em> (<em>houe</em> kingdom)
is "man of the kingdom." The same is the
structure of the Teutonic and Scandinavian languages,
ex. gr., <em>day light</em>, &amp;c.; but while all the others make
the two substantives form one word, the English sometimes
keeps them separate, sometimes unites them by
a hyphen, and at other times makes them into one
word. Hence we may observe, by the way, that it is
needless, as well as cacophonous, to add an '<em>s</em> to a substantive
ending in that letter; even the simple turned
comma is superfluous, the position alone indicating its
genitive sense.</p>

<p>It appears that not only nouns but pronouns were
so employed. In the first page of the Canterbury
Tales we have&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And bathed every veyne in swich licour,</div>
<div class="i0">Of <em>which</em> vertue engendred is the flour.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Here <em>which</em> is a genitive, for which we should now
use <em>whose</em> (the genitive of <em>who</em>), a pronoun that our
forefathers used of things as well as persons.</p>

<p>In like manner, though <em>his</em> was the usual genitive
of <em>it</em> as well as of <em>he</em>, it was not uncommon to make
the genitive by simply prefixing <em>it</em>, as in</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Lord, how it could so prettily have prated with <em>it</em> tongue!</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Romeus and Juliet, 1562.</p>

<p>and other passages. I do not think it ever occurs in
Chaucer, Gower, or Piers Ploughman.</p>

<p>I am therefore of opinion that Shakespeare may be
regarded as the chief agent in introducing <em>its</em> into the
language. It is to be noticed that it never occurs
in the Bible, only thrice, or rather only twice, in
Milton, and but once in Waller. Chatterton used it
twice in the very first page of his Poems of Rowley;
yet the critics of the time did not discern this plain
proof of forgery!</p>

<p>On the disputed question of the use of <em>his</em> for the
genitive, I will only observe that the fact is that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
preceding noun is used absolutely. Thus, as we have
"The king, he is hunting the deer," so we have "the
king, his palace." The same structure precisely is to be
met with in Dutch and German&mdash;we meet with it, for
instance, in Schiller's Wallenstein; and Captain Burton
informs us that in the Kariri language of Eastern
Africa, "The Kazi's brother," for example, is <em>Kazi-ih-zo</em>,
literally "The Kazi, his brother."</p>

<h3>II. THE VERSE.</h3>

<h4>15.</h4>

<p>Chaucer introduced into English poetry the iambic
verse of five feet, formed by the Provençals in imitation
of the Classic Phaleucian and Sapphic hendecasyllables,
and adopted from them by the Italian poets. These
last, however, though they held the principle of admitting
but five <em>ictus</em> in a line, did not limit themselves
to eleven syllables, as the following examples will
show:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Che passa i monti, e rompe i muri e l'armi.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Dante, Inf. xvii. 2.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">L'oro, e le perle, e i fior vermigli, e i bianchi.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Non danno i colpi, or finti, or pieni, or scarsi.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Tasso, Ger. Lib. xii. 55.</p>

<p>So the Greeks in their dramatic iambics admitted
trisyllabic feet, Æschylus admitting one foot, Sophocles
two, Euripides three; while the comic poets, both
Greek and Latin, used these feet still more freely, not,
however, exceeding the limit of three.</p>

<p>Chaucer did not allow himself the same licence as
his masters. He sometimes admits one such foot,
rarely two, and three, I believe, only once. He also uses
at times the Alexandrine or verse of six feet.</p>

<p>The first who used this verse for the drama in England
was Bishop Bale, who in 1538 published three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Interludes, as he termed them, or dramatic pieces on
Scriptural subjects. Here are a few lines from the one
named God's Promises:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">In the begynnynge, before the heavens were create,</div>
<div class="i0">In me and of me was my sonne sempyternall,</div>
<div class="i0">With the Holy Ghost, in one degre or estate</div>
<div class="i0">Of the hygh godhed, to make the Father coequall,</div>
<div class="i0">And thys my Sonne was with me one God essencyall,</div>
<div class="i0">Without separacyon at any tyme from me,</div>
<div class="i0">True God he is of equall dignytè.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The feet, it will be seen, are here of two or three
syllables indifferently; and the same is the case in the
couplets which occur also in these plays.</p>

<p>About the same time Nicholas Udall wrote his comedy
of Ralph Roister Doister&mdash;not printed till 1566&mdash;in
which we have the earliest specimen of the verse afterwards
chiefly used for comedy, namely, one of four feet,
the foot of two, three, and even four syllables. It commences
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">As long lyveth the mery man (they say)</div>
<div class="i0">As doth the sory man, and longer by a day,</div>
<div class="i0">Yet the Grassehopper for all his Sommer pipyng</div>
<div class="i0">Sterveth in Winter wyth hungrie gripyng.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>This measure may be seen in Damon and Pitheas,
New Custom, Gammer Gurton's Needle, and other
plays, in which we shall find it admitting lines of five
and even six and seven feet,&mdash;<em>ex. gr.</em>,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">That state is most miserable. Thrise happy are we</div>
<div class="i0">Whom true love hath joined in perfect amity.</div>
<div class="i0">Which amity first sprung, without vaunting be it spoken that is true,</div>
<div class="i0">Of likeliness of manners, took root by company, and now is conserved by virtue.&mdash;Damon and Pitheas.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Contemporary with Bale and Udall, the illustrious
Earl of Surrey had introduced into English a new species
of verse&mdash;blank verse. This was a five-foot iambic
measure without rime, and admitting of verses of six
feet. His version of two books of the Æneis in this
measure was printed in 1557; and five years later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Jan. 18, 1561-2, a play written in it and named Gordebuc,
by Norton and Sackville, was performed before
Queen Elizabeth at Whitehall, and it was given to
the press in 1566. But more than twenty years elapsed
before blank verse made its first appearance on the
public stage in the Tamburlain of Marlow. From its
inherent superiority, it at once became the established
form for the drama, still mingled, however, with riming
couplets and stanzas.</p>

<h4>16.</h4>

<p>I have already expressed my opinion that the earliest
among the extant dramas of Shakespeare <em>may</em> have
been The Comedy of Errors. This is in blank
verse, in general strictly decasyllabic, mingled with
the riming measures above noticed. His next play
would seem to have been The Two Gentlemen of
Verona, much of the same form, but differing from
it, and from its immediate successors, by admitting in
its blank verse trisyllabic feet, as in</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful.&mdash;iv. 4.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>It might seem as if the poet were hesitating about
the adoption of a freer kind of verse such as came
afterwards into use. Love's Labour's Lost, and the
other plays in Meres' list&mdash;to which, as may be seen,
The Taming of the Shrew is to be added&mdash;are all
of the same kind. As he advanced in his career, he
gradually discarded rime, and admitted the trisyllabic
foot more frequently. He also learned to run his verses
into each other, thus forming a system; the preposition,
for instance, ending one line, and the word it governed
beginning the next line.</p>

<p>The blank verse of Surrey and of the authors of Gordebuc&mdash;admitting,
as we have seen, verses of six feet&mdash;may
be regarded as strictly decasyllabic. But when it
became the standard verse of the theatres it gradually
relaxed from its strictness, and admitted trisyllabic
feet more and more as it advanced, so that in Fletcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
we actually meet with lines containing fifteen syllables,
though of no more than five feet. It is most strange
that, with these facts staring them, as I may say, in the
face, editors, almost without exception, seem to have
been haunted by a spectre of five decasyllabic feet. "How
often," says Gifford, "will it be necessary to observe
that our old dramatists never counted their syllables
on their fingers!" They also seem to be unaware of
the existence of Alexandrines, or verses of six feet. The
play of Othello, for instance, is as full of them as Dryden's
riming couplet verse; and yet Mr. Dyce&mdash;whom
I generally notice as being usually regarded as a leading
critic&mdash;writes frequently as if such a line were not
admissible in dramatic verse.</p>

<p>Again, there are critics who regard a verse as good if
it contains ten syllables, no matter how made or how
arranged.</p>

<p>Thus Malone gives as good verses,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">What wheels, racks, fires, flaying, boiling.&mdash;W. T. iii. 2.</div>

<div class="i0">Poürs into captains' wounds? banishment.&mdash;Timon, iii. 5.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Mr. Collier regards as a good verse,</p>
<div class="center">

<div class="i0">To yond generation you shall find.&mdash;M. for M. iv. 3.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>"Doth comfort thee in <em>thy</em> sleep. Live and flourish"
is the usual reading in Rich. III. v. 5; mine is at least
more euphonious.</p>

<p>It has never to my knowledge been sufficiently noticed
that Shakespeare makes occasional use of the seven-foot
verse of Golding's Ovid and Phaer's Virgil, works
in which it is evident he was extremely well-read.
Such are the following lines:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<h4>17.</h4>

<p>I will now make a few general observations on the
dramatic verse of Shakespeare and his contemporaries.
In the first place, as observed above, we may lay it down
as a general rule that their verse&mdash;I may perhaps include
even that of Marston&mdash;is never rugged or inharmonious,
but that when it appears to be so it is owing
to the copyist or the printer, or to the fact of the
manuscript having been damaged, and not unfrequently
to want of skill in the reader.</p>

<p>An apparent cause of imperfection in lines is the
reader's ignorance of the poet's mode of pronunciation.
Thus it was then the custom&mdash;one not quite lost yet&mdash;in
prose as well as in verse, if two words came together,
one ending, the other beginning, with an accented syllable
to throw back the former accent: hence Shakespeare
said, for example, "the dívine Desdemona." If critics
kept this fact in mind, they would not reject Tieck's excellent
emendation of "the précise Angelo" for "the prenzic
Angelo" in Measure for Measure, on account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
accent, when in the very same play we have "a cómplete
bosom," i. 4; "O just, but sévere law!" ii. 2;
"Will bélieve this," <em>ib.</em>; "Our cómpell'd sins," <em>ib.</em> 4,
&amp;c.; we have actually "précise villains," ii. 1. How
would they read</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Might córrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">(Hen. VIII. v. 1)?</p>

<p>In fine, it must be remembered that <em>ion</em>, <em>ien</em>, and
other double vowels were pronounced dissyllabically,
as <em>oceän</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Again, neither editors nor readers are in general
aware that poets like Shakespeare, who were born in
those parts of England where the <em>r</em> at the end of words
or syllables has the light sound peculiar to the English
language, frequently pronounce as dissyllables those
monosyllables, such as <em>fire</em>, <em>hour</em>, <em>more</em>, <em>where</em>, &amp;c., ending
in <em>r</em> after a long vowel or diphthong, as in</p>
<div class="center">

<p>Here "where" is to be pronounced nearly <em>wheaa</em>; for so
the English really do pronounce it, though they may
fancy such not to be the case. Malone, as being an Irishman,
seems to have been the first to notice it. Of these
monosyllables there are upwards of thirty in Shakespeare,
and as many in Fletcher; while in the learned
Jonson we only meet with <em>fire</em>, <em>hour</em>, <em>our</em>, <em>your</em>, <em>wear</em>.
In my Edition, and in this work, I have marked them
with a diæresis, as <em>whëre</em>, <em>heär</em>, &amp;c. It is rather
remarkable that it is almost solely to his higher characters,
such as Hamlet and Coriolanus, that Shakespeare
gives this pronunciation. We also find this dissyllabic
pronunciation in such words as <em>born</em>, <em>morn</em>, <em>horn</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As in French poetry the <em>e muet</em> in words forms a
distinct syllable, <em>ennemi</em>, for example, being read as a
trisyllable; so we find <em>angry</em>, <em>entrance</em>, <em>children</em>, <em>mistress</em>
(often written <em>misteris</em>), <em>country</em>, <em>witness</em>, <em>juggler</em>, <em>wondrous</em>,
&amp;c., forming three, <em>remembrance</em> four syllables.
<em>Captain</em> was sometimes <em>capitain</em>, as in French. Many
of these cases, we may observe, are mere solutions of
contractions, <em>angry</em>, for example, being simply <em>angery</em>
contracted.</p>

<p>In opposition to the commonly received theory, I
will venture to lay it down as a fixed principle that the
dramatic poets rarely, if ever, used short lines, except
in speeches of a single line, or in the first or the last
line of a speech. This will be apparent to any one who
examines the pages of Jonson and Massinger, who
printed their plays themselves, or those plays of Shakespeare,
Fletcher, and others which are the most correctly
printed. Wherever a line of less than five feet
occurs, it will be found to have been produced by
omission of words or by malarrangement of the text.
In plays such as Timon, Troilus and Cressida, or
Fletcher's Sea Voyage, of which the original copy was
in bad condition, lines of this kind are of course most
numerous. I may here observe that in this last-named
play, the metre of which Mr. Dyce has pronounced to
be "<em>incurably</em> defective," I have, by simple rearrangement
of the text, rendered it as correct as in any other
of Fletcher's plays.</p>

<p>Even in this also Shakespeare took liberties in which
his brethren did not venture to indulge. <em>He</em> began and
ended not only speeches, but paragraphs of speeches,
with short lines. Nay, he even made the concluding
short line of one paragraph and the incipient short line
of the next form a single line, thus&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>In the case of final riming couplets the first line may
be short, but <em>never</em> the second.</p>

<h4>19.</h4>

<p>Nothing is more common in the works of our old
dramatists than malarrangement of the text, some lines
being too long, some too short; but among them they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
are sure to contain the requisite number of feet. Editors
have often taken the most justifiable liberty of rearranging
the text; but on other occasions they have exclaimed
against those who have followed their example. In this
case, however, the only limit to the discretion of an
editor is that of not putting&mdash;except in the cases above
mentioned&mdash;more or less than five or six feet in a line.
I must not omit to observe that editors have done injury
to many passages, by the decasyllabic superstition which
I have already noticed.</p>

<p>I will give one instance of a place where a most slight
rearrangement gives perfect harmony to what has been
a stumblingblock to editors:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him</div>
<div class="i0">Bootless home, and weather-beaten back.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">1 Hen. IV. iii. 1.</p>

<p>The last line, it will be seen, is the merest prose, but
transfer "him" to it from the preceding line, and we
at once get harmonious verse.</p>

<p>The following passages are thus arranged in the original
editions:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling; doth glance</div>
<div class="i0">From heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</div>
<div class="i0">And, as imagination bodies forth the forms of things</div>
<div class="i0">Unknown, the poet's pen turns them to shapes,</div>
<div class="i0">And gives to airy nothing a local habitation</div>
<div class="i0">And a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination, &amp;c.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Mids. Night's Dream, v. 1.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">It seldom visits Sorrow; when it doth, it is a comforter.</div>
<div class="i0">We two, my lord, will guard your person,</div>

<div class="i0">Thank you. Wondrous heavy.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Temp. ii. 1.</p>

<p>Those, then, who would refuse an editor the right of
rearrangement are bound, if they would be consistent,
to retain such passages as these unaltered. I may here
make the boast that mine is the <em>only</em> edition of these
plays in which the text is strictly metrical throughout.</p>

<h4>20.</h4>

<p>Beside all those forms of verse, the plays of our old
dramatists contain a large quantity of prose. But it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
is only prose to the eye; for it is in reality as metrical
as what is printed in separate metric lines, consisting
of lines of five or six feet, each of two or three syllables,
but printed continuously like prose. I therefore denominate
it "<em>Metric Prose</em>" as being metric in substance,
prose in form, and as, moreover, it is termed <em>prose</em> both
by Chaucer and Shakespeare, probably from its less
elevated character and from its being written continuously
and without rime or alliteration. I am disposed
to regard the former as being its inventor; and
perhaps his reason for writing it continuously may have
been merely the wish to save paper. We know, from
M. de Maucroix's letter to Boileau, that the French poet
Racan, whose poems were of course in rime, also wrote
them continuously, and, as it would appear, for the
same reason, though paper must have been less valuable
in his time. As, however, the Anglo-Saxon and early
English alliterative verse was written continuously,
Chaucer may have been only following an established
mode. It may be remarked that the poetry of the
Hebrew Scriptures is also written and printed continuously.</p>

<p>Surely it is no egotism to state a plain truth! I
therefore say that, as far as I know, I am myself the
very first who, for the last century or more, has discerned
the existence of this metric prose. My discovery
was very gradual. I first recognized it in the
plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, and, advancing step
by step, I at length arrived at the certainty that for
three centuries and a half, from Chaucer and Wickliffe
to Dryden and Tillotson, almost every work claiming to
be regarded as a literary composition is in this form.
Such are histories from Sir T. More to Clarendon, translations,
controversial and philosophical works, as those
of Hooker, Brown, Taylor, and Cudworth, versions of the
Scriptures from Wickliffe to the authorized one inclusive,
sermons, inclusive of those of Barrow, South, and Tillotson,
the Liturgy, except the Creeds, Te Deum, and Catechism,
all prefaces, dedications and letters of compliment, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
The chief exceptions were Hall and the other chroniclers,
Purchas, Hakluyt, Fuller, Bunyan, Ludlow,
L'Estrange, and Mrs. Hutchinson. The Ecclesiastical
Policy, The Liberty of Prophesying, and The Areopagitica,
for example, are as decidedly metrical as The
Paradise Lost, only admitting more trisyllabic feet,
and being printed continuously. Hence, too, in a great
measure, arises the charm which we find in the prose
of our old writers, and of which we have been ignorant
of the secret source; as when Cowper styles Sidney
"warbler of poetic prose."</p>

<p>I do not, however, say that this prose was read as
verse, with a slight elevation of tone at the end of each
metric line. It was, I think, read as prose, as Cowper
of course read the Arcadia; but the metre diffused a
secret charm through it, which could be felt even by
those who were ignorant of the cause. How easy, by
the way, must this mode of writing prose have made
verse-making to the writers of those days! and how
rapidly that prose could be written is proved by the
assertion of Sir Kenelm Digby, who says that in the
space of twenty-four hours he sent out and bought the
Religio Medici, read it through, and wrote his Observations
on it, which fill upwards of seventy printed
pages, and are metrical&mdash;a fact almost inconceivable.</p>

<p>The only writer of the last century who, as far as I
am aware, used this metric prose&mdash;for we seek it in vain
in Addison, Pope, Johnson, Gibbon, &amp;c.&mdash;is the historian
Robertson, of which fact Mr. Buckle seems to have had
a dim conception; for he speaks of his "<em>measured</em>
style." It is a question where Robertson got it; for he
could hardly have invented it, and I think it must have
been in Knox, Spottiswoode, and the Scottish writers
of the two preceding centuries, who all wrote like their
English contemporaries. At the same period, however,
his countryman Macpherson invented a new kind of
metric prose for his 'Poems of Ossian.' Even the present
century presents us with an instance in Mr. Lecky's
eloquent 'History of Rationalism,' which is as metrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
as the Areopagitica of Milton. Possibly my own
remarks on the subject in 'Notes and Queries' may
have directed his attention to it.</p>

<p>Gascoigne's comedy of The Supposes, performed in
1566, a translation from the Italian of Ariosto, appears
to have been the first play written in this metric prose;
Lyly also, somewhat later, wrote in it his courtly comedies;
and it gradually, combined with blank verse, got
entire possession of the scene. The last, I believe, to
use it was Dryden. Ordinary prose&mdash;probably in imitation
of the French and Italian comic drama&mdash;seems
to have been first used after the Restoration, in the
comedies of Killigrew, Shadwell, Wycherley, Etheridge,
Sedley, and other dramatists of that period.</p>

<p>It is rather remarkable that a union of verse and
prose, similar to this union of regular and irregular
verse of our drama, occurs also in that of India. Sir
William Jones tells us, in his preface to Sacontala, that
the Hindoo plays "are all in verse where the dialogue
is elevated, and in prose where it is familiar." Coleridge,
who had not the slightest suspicion of the existence
of metre in the dramatic prose, makes the following
just remarks in a note on Fletcher's Custom of
the Country:&mdash;"In all comic metres the gulping of
short syllables and the abbreviation of syllables ordinarily
long, by the rapid pronunciation of eagerness and
vehemence, are not so much a licence as a law&mdash;a faithful
copy of nature." This I think completely justifies
the frequent use of the syncope and synæresis in metric
prose.</p>

<p>The same critic again says of Milton's noble conclusion
of his treatise 'Of Reformation in England,'
"Written in the fervour of his youthful imagination, in
a high poetic strain that wanted metre only to become
a lyrical poem." He felt, but did not see, that the metre
actually <em>was</em> there.</p>

<p>The fact of this prose being metric causes us sometimes
to doubt whether a passage should be printed as
verse or as prose; and sometimes what is verse in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
edition is prose in another. Thus Mercutio's celebrated
account of Queen Mab, in Romeo and Juliet, which is
most perfect decasyllabic verse, is properly printed as
such in the 4to, 1597, while in all the subsequent early
editions it is made prose; and prose it would probably
have been at this day had no copy of that edition remained.
On the other hand, most modern editors have
most improperly printed the Nurse's speeches in the
preceding scene as verse, while they are, and rightly,
prose in all the original editions. An editor is, I think,
at perfect liberty to use his judgement in this matter.</p>

<p>The following extracts, in which the termination of
each line is marked, will enable the reader to judge of
the truth of my theory. I must at the same time
remind him that such contractions as <em>I'll</em>, <em>I've</em>, are
rare in these prose scenes, such being left to the
knowledge and skill of the actor or reader.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion. | <em>He</em>
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns; | and, as
thou sayest, charged my brother on his blessing | to breed
me well; and there begins my sadness. | My brother Jacques
he keeps at school, and report | speaks goldenly of his profit;
for my part he keeps me | rustically at home, or, to
speak more properly, | stays me here at home unkept; for
call you that keeping | for a gentleman of my birth, that
differs not from the stalling | of an ox? His horses are bred
better; for besides that | they are fair with their feeding,
they are taught their manage, | and to that end riders dearly
hired; but I, his brother,| gain nothing under him but
growth, for the which | his animals on his dunghills are as
much | bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he | so
plentifully gives me, the something that Nature gave me | his
countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed |
with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much
as | in him lies mines my gentility with my education. |
This it is, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of my
father, | which I think is within me, begins to mutiny |
against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, | though
yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it."&mdash;As You Like
It, i. 1.</p>

<p>"I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation | prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>your discovery, and your secresy | to the king and queen
moult no feather. I have of late |&mdash;but wherefore I know
not&mdash;lost all my mirth, | foregone all custom of exercises,
and indeed | it goes so heavily with my disposition, | that
this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile | promontory,
this most excellent canopy, | the air, look you, this
brave o'erhanging firmament, | this majestical roof, fretted
with golden fire, | why, it appeareth nothing to me but |
a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. | What a piece
of work is a man! how noble in reason! | how infinite in
faculties! in form and moving | how express and admirable!
in action how like an angel! | in apprehension how like a
god! | the beauty of the world! the paragon | of animals!
And yet to me what is | this quintessence of dust? Man
delights not me; | no, nor woman neither, though by your
smiling you seem to say so."&mdash;Hamlet, ii. 2.</p>

<p>"Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.&mdash;Without his
roe, | like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou
fishified! | Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed
in; | Laura to his lady was a kitchen-wench; | marry, she
had a better love to be-rime her; | Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra
a gypsy; | Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisby |
a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. | Signior Romeo,
<em>bon jour</em>. There's a French salutation | to your French slop.
You gave us the counterfeit | fairly last night."&mdash;Romeo and
Juliet, ii. 4.</p>

<p>"Nay, sure, | he's not in hell. He's in Arthur's bosom,
if ever | man went to Arthur's bosom. 'A made a finer
end, | and went away as it had been any christom child. |
'A parted even just between twelve and one, | even at the
turning of the tide. For after I saw him | fumble with the
sheets, and play with flowers, and smile | upon his finger's
end, I knew there was but one way; | for his nose was as
sharp as a pen, and 'a babbled of green fields. | How now,
Sir John! quoth I. What, man! be of good cheer! | So
'a cried out God, God, God! three or four times. | Now I,
to comfort him, bid him he should not think of God; | I
hoped there was no need to trouble himself | with any such
thoughts yet. So 'a bade me lay | more clothes on his
feet. I put my hand into the bed, | and felt them, and they
were as cold as any stone. | Then I felt to his knees, and so
upward and upward, and all was | as cold as any stone."&mdash;King
Henry V. ii. 3.</p></blockquote>

I prefer <em>un</em>distain'd. The printer was more likely to omit
<em>un</em> (see on Cymb. i. 7) than to change it to <em>di</em>. There is

<p>To be merry in spite of mirth is like laughing in spite of
laughter, dying in spite of death, living in spite of life&mdash;pure
nonsense. With great confidence I therefore made the correction
<em>my wife</em>, and so gave it in my Edition. Meeting,
however, in the Cambridge Edition with Theobald's correction
<em>wrath</em>&mdash;for Editors had ignored it&mdash;I saw at once that the
poet must have written <em>my wrath</em> (see Introd. p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>), which
resembles 'mirth' both in form and sound, and I have therefore
adopted it without hesitation. Like a similar correction
in Twelfth Night, i. 1, I regard it as absolutely certain.</p>

<p>I have printed 'hears' for the 'hairs' of the folio, as it

Chaucer, and frequently of Spenser; and in his early plays
Shakespeare indulged in riming archaisms of this kind occasionally.
We are to recollect that this play was not printed
till thirty years after it had been written, and by that time
<em>hair</em> had been established as the sole orthography. The
matter is, however, put out of dispute by the Poems, in which
Shakespeare himself spells it <em>hear</em> when riming with <em>tear</em> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>

</div>
<p>This, except the punctuation, is the reading of the folio;
that of the 4to, 1598, is:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"So you, to study now it is too late,</div>
<div class="i0">Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>To which editors have given the preference, not a little, I
think, moved by what seemed to them the metric regularity
of the last line. I prefer the reading of the folio, and explain
it thus:&mdash;Berowne had just been showing how he
liked everything in its due time and season; and youth
being the proper time for instituting a course of study, it
was, he thought, as absurd for them who were full-grown
men to set about it, as it would be for a man who wanted
to unlock the gate of his court-yard to climb over the house
to get to it. A couplet, however, may have been lost; for
'So you,' &amp;c., joins but awkwardly with what precedes; but
I believe the true solution of the difficulty is that the poet
wrote '<em>For</em> you,' &amp;c. We have instances of the confusion
of these words in Com. of Err. i. 1, 1 Hen. IV. i. 3, Macb. i.
2, Son. xliv. 5. I have so given it in my Edition. There
seems to be much more humour in the reading of the folio,
caused by the aposiopesis, than in that of the 4to, where
'the <em>little</em> gate' makes a difficulty; but the meaning may
be, they were giving themselves a deal of labour for a
very trifling result. I think the reading of the 4to may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
have arisen thus. In the transcript from which it was
printed "That were to" may have been effaced or omitted,
and then 'little' was added to complete the metre.</p>

<p>It is most certain that 'school' cannot have been the
poet's word. The usual reading is that of Warburton, <em>scowl</em>;
but that substantive is not used by Shakespeare, and it
gives but an indifferent sense. Theobald read <em>stole</em>, which
also is not Shakespearian; I myself <em>cloak</em>, as the "cloak of
night" occurs in R. and J. ii. 2, Rich. II. iii. 2. But the
Cambridge editors seem to have hit on the exact word, <em>suit</em>
written, as pronounced, <em>shoot</em>. In the Puritan (ii. 1), we
have a play on <em>suitor</em> and <em>archer</em>, <em>i.e.</em> shooter; we retain
this sound in <em>sure</em> and <em>sugar</em>. In Hamlet we have "suits of
solemn black" and "suits of woe" (i. 2), and "suit of sables"
(iii. 2) for mourning, and in Rom. and Jul. iii. 2,</p>

<p>Capell sagaciously saw that in this speech, from "For

"For where is any" to "And in that vow," are passages
which the poet had cancelled in the "corrected and augmented"
play. The same occurs in Rich. III. v. 3, and

<p>The 2nd folio reads, and, I think, most properly, 'affec<em>ta</em>tion.'
It is much more likely that a syllable should have

<p>This is Theobald's correction of <em>bene intelligo</em>.'&mdash;<em>Boone,

scratcht, twill serve.' Ingenious as this is, I still adhere to
Theobald; for, as I have just observed, French does not
occur in this play; and when those critics say that "Sir
Nathaniel is not represented as an ignoramus who would
be likely to say <em>bone</em> for <em>bene</em>," I may remind them that he
adds, 'Videsne <em>quis</em> venit,' which is nearly as bad. The
printer, in fact, had spoiled the humour by his <em>bene</em>, and
Theobald restored it, as I think, most happily.</p>

<div class="i0">Dies in the zeal of that which it presents."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The whole difficulty of this place lies in the word 'dies,'
which has two senses, now distinguished by the orthography,
namely, <em>die</em> and <em>dye</em>, but which in Shakespeare's time were
spelt indifferently. In this place editors have invariably taken
it in the former sense; and as they regard 'contents dies'
as a false concord&mdash;which, by the way, it is not&mdash;they print
'Die,' and then change 'that' to <em>them</em>, and alter the punctuation.
The result, however, is anything but satisfactory.
I, on the contrary&mdash;and I believe I have been the first to do
so&mdash;take 'Dies' in its second sense of tinging, colouring,
imbruing, making 'zeal' the subject and 'contents' the
object, and regarding this last as being by metonymy&mdash;a
figure Shakespeare uses so frequently&mdash;the persons contented,
or to be contented, just as in Ant. and Cleop. i. 4. "The
Discontents" are the discontented. All then becomes plain,
and the passage is parallel to one in the speech of Theseus
in M. N. D. v. 1. As to using 'Dyes' of mind, we may
justify it by the employment of <em>tinge</em> and <em>tincture</em> in the
same way in our ordinary language; and the following passages
are very apposite:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"When my new mind had no infusion known,</div>
<div class="i0">Thou gav'st so deep a tincture of thine own,</div>
<div class="i0">That ever since I vainly try</div>
<div class="i0">To wash away the inherent dye."</div>

(Killigrew, Parson's Wedding, ii. 3.) "Ma ben di rado
avviene che le parole affermative e sicure d'una persona
autorevole in qualsivoglia genere <em>non tingano dal loro colore la
mente di chi le ascolta</em>." (Manzoni, Prom. Sposi, ch. xx.)
The 'zeal' in the last line may have been produced in the
usual way by that in the preceding line, and the poet's word
have been <em>hue</em>; but a change is not absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>This is complementary to the preceding speech, of which

her meaning is that her virginity is not yet old and withered.
She stops there, and enters on a new subject, and it is evident
that at least the first line is lost. It may have been
like this, "<em>Monsieur Parolles, you are for the Court</em>," which I
have ventured to insert in my Edition; it seems so essential
to the sense.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"A mother, and a mistress, and a friend."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>None of the editors seem to have perceived that in this
and the six following lines Helena is enumerating the titles,
mostly Euphuistic, that lovers at that time used to give
their mistresses (comp. L.L.L. iii. 1 <em>ad fin.</em>), "Christendoms,"
<em>i.e.</em> baptismal names, as she styles them, to which Cupid
stood gossip. As 'mother' could hardly have been one of
these, I feel almost certain that the original word was <em>lover</em>,
which being damaged and only <em>er</em> remaining (see on ii. 1),
the printer made 'mother' of it. There is, however, it
seems a term <em>mauther</em> or <em>mother</em> still in use in the Eastern
counties, and signifying young girl. In Fletcher's Maid in
the Mill (iii. 2), the miller says of his daughter,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"A pretty child she is, although I say it,</div>
<div class="i0">A handsome <em>mother</em>."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>In the Alchemist (iv. 4) Kastrill says to his sister, "You
talk like a foolish <em>mauther</em>." Tusser has in his Husbandry,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"No sooner a sowing but out by and by,</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"A sling for a <em>mother</em>, a bow for a boy."</div>

</div>
<p>But surely such a term could not be used of the ladies of the
Court of France. The context shows that it is not mother-in-law
that is meant. 'Captain' in the next line may appear
suspicious; but lovers were in the habit of regarding
their mistresses as commanders, whose orders they were
bound to obey. "She that I spake of our great captain's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>

and <em>be</em>. For a similar omission of <em>'d</em>, see on King John iv.
2. The 'no,' however, may have been a casual insertion of
the printer's. In my Edition of these plays, unaware of the
rime, I placed <em>be</em> at the end of the line; but I corrected it.</p>

<p>The folio has <em>'ton tooth to th' other</em>. The 2nd folio made
the necessary correction by rejecting <em>tooth</em>&mdash;a mere reduplication

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"> "Let higher Italy," etc.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>This passage has never been understood, yet it is perhaps
plain enough. By 'higher Italy' is meant the part more
distant from France. "Will you travel higher [<em>i.e.</em> go
further south], or return again to France," iv. 3. In this
place it is Tuscany that is termed 'higher Italy.' "But then
<em>up farther</em>, and as far as Rome," Tam. of Shrew, iv. 2, where
the speaker is at Padua. By 'bated' is meant abated, subdued,
as we <em>abate</em> a nuisance; 'inherit' is, as usual, possess;
and 'the fall of the last monarchy' is the fallen final state
of the Roman Empire, the last monarchy according to the current
interpretation of the Book of Daniel. "The antique ruins
of <em>the Roman Fall</em>."&mdash;F. Q. i. 549. "The underseated deities
that circle Saturn's fall."&mdash;Chap. II. xv. 208. "Redeem'd
him from his fall and made him mine."&mdash;Fletch. Kt. of Burn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Pest. iv. 3. But perhaps we should read <em>pall</em>, as being still
more contemptuous, indicating that the symbol only and
not the real power had been inherited. By 'Those,' etc., I
think are meant the Ghibelines or Imperial party, to which
Siena belonged, while Florence was usually Guelf, the side
which was always taken by France, out of opposition to the
German Emperor. There is, however, no mention of Guelfs
or Ghibelines either in the story in the Decamerone or in
the Palace of Pleasure; so that Shakespeare must have
gotten his knowledge elsewhere, which is to me one proof,
among many, of the extent of his reading. I regard this as
the only explanation that gives sense to the passage.</p>

<p>This is the arrangement of the folio, which Malone altered
needlessly. For 'see' Theobald read <em>fee</em>, and in the next
line <em>bought</em> for 'brought.' These corrections most editors
have adopted, but I see no great gain in them. I confess I
do not clearly discern the meaning here of either 'see' or
<em>fee</em>; and Mr. Staunton's <em>sue</em> is not much better, and I suspect
that the poet's word may have been a different one, which
I think I can fix on with something like certainty. He
wrote then 'I <em>beseech</em> thee,' but <em>ch</em> being either blotted or
rubbed out, the transcriber or printer read <em>I be</em> 'Ile,' the
usual form of <em>I'll</em>. In Ham. iii. 4, and Tim. i. 2, we have
a similar effacement of two letters. "Pardon, my lord.&mdash;I
pray you all, stand up" (M. N. D. iv. 1), is exactly parallel.

<p>By 'brief' I would understand the marriage-contract; for
<em>brief</em> is used with great latitude. So in v. 3 we have "a
sweet verbal <em>brief</em>," <em>i.e.</em> commission or address. The 'now
borne' of the folio is, I think, <em>now-born</em>, <em>i.e.</em> which has just
come into being, been made. Possibly we might read <em>new-born</em>,
like "things <em>new-born</em>" (W. T. iii. 3), "<em>new-born</em>
gauds" (Tr. and Cr. iii. 3). We have <em>now</em> for <em>new</em>

</div>
<p>No sense in which <em>peer</em> is used will answer here. I once
thought that 'still' might be taken in the sense of quiet,
tranquil; but I have been unable to find an instance of its
being so used in composition. It seems, however, to have
found favour in the eyes of Mr. Dyce. The reading generally
adopted is that of Steevens, <em>piecing</em>; and though the
usual meaning of this verb is, to eke, to add, it is also used
in the sense of closing, filling. Mr. Dyce doubts if "a
poet with a delicate ear would have written <em>piecing ...
piercing</em>," not recollecting that the latter was pronounced
<em>percing</em>. I should, however, prefer <em>fleeting</em>, which I have
given in my Edition. In the Third Part of The Seven
Champions (ch. xiii.), the author of which was more than
once indebted to Shakespeare, or <em>vice versâ</em>, we read,
"Whose feathery arrows outrun the <em>piercing</em> eye, and cut a
passage through the <em>fleetiag</em> air." Spenser, too, has (F. Q.
ii. 8. 2) "the <em>flitting</em> sky (<em>i.e.</em> air)." Elsewhere he says (vii.
7 22) that the air is felt "to <em>flit still</em>," and in The Tempest
(iii. 3) we meet with the "still-closing waters." At the
same time, as 'peering' may have been suggested by
'piercing' in the next line, the poet's word may not have
resembled it.</p>

<p>Here, as in ii. 3, the verb 'write' makes no sense. The

fetch of <em>warrant</em>" of the folio, my first impulse was to
read <em>I warrant</em>&mdash;also that of the editors of the Globe Shakespeare;
but I then fixed on "<em>I wis</em>," and so it stands in my
Edition. I am now convinced that the reading of the 2nd
folio, when properly pointed, is the true one. I point it
thus: "Ay, right.&mdash;Good creature! wheresoe'er she is."
The 'Ay, right,' expresses the widow's assent to the truth
of her daughter's observation; she then proceeds to speak of
Helena. To my great surprise and gratification, I found,
after I had made this natural and certain correction, that I
had been completely anticipated in it by Capell. How it
does provoke one to think of the wilful blindness or obtuseness
of editors! For nearly an entire century they have
had the true reading before their eyes, and never could see
it! Singer has "Ay, right; good creature" etc.; but the
punctuation shows he did not understand the passage.</p>

<div class="i0">"I see that men make ropes in such a scarre,</div>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>This is evident nonsense. Rowe read <em>hopes</em> and <em>affairs</em>
for 'ropes' and 'scarre'; and to this emendation, or Mitford's
of <em>case</em> for 'scarre,' I see no very serious objection.
We have "make envy" (Hen. VIII. v. 2), "make doubt"
(<em>Ib.</em>), "make comfort" (Cymb. i. 2), "making practice"
(Meas. for Meas. iii. 2). Why then object to "make hopes?"
even though it is to be found nowhere else in Shakespeare.
'Scarre,' however, is probably right; in Lingua (i. 6) we
have, "Poets will write whole volumes of this <em>scar</em>." It
must be remembered that <em>scare</em> was written <em>scarre</em>, and so as
a substantive 'scarre' may be fright, alarm, flutter, perturbation.
Finally, it is even possible that 'ropes' may be right,
a line being lost; something of this sort: "<em>Of oaths and
vows to scale our fort, in hope.</em>"</p>

<div class="i0">Where violets and the nodding oxlip grows,</div>

<p>In the second line I have transposed 'oxlip' and 'violet';
for the former 'nods' and the latter does not, "With cowslips
wan, that hang the pensive head" (Lycidas, <em>v.</em> 14).
In the third I give <em>o'er</em> for 'over.' The transposition which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
follows is imperatively demanded by the sequence of ideas,
and we have other instances in this play. The fifth and
sixth lines may have been an addition made by the poet or
transcriber in the margin, and taken in in the wrong place
by the printer. (See on i. 1.) If 'And' be the right word
in the last line, something must have been lost, <em>ex. gr.</em>
"Upon her will I steal there as she lies;" but the poet's
word may have been what I have given, <em>Then</em>, strongly
emphaticized, and written <em>Than</em>, the two first letters of
which having been effaced, the printer made it 'And.' The
very same thing seems to have taken place in L. L. L. v. 2.
It may also have been that <em>y</em><sup>n</sup>, then, was taken for &amp;, and.</p>

<p>It is very strange that none of the critics should have
seen that <em>S.</em> is <em>Signior</em>, not <em>Saint</em>. The poet probably wrote
it <em>Sr</em>; for we shall find in the subsequent part of the play <em>sir</em>
twice used for <em>signior</em>, the ordinary address in plays the scene
of which lies in Italy. The 4to edition of 1631 omits S., but
it is of no authority. I should feel inclined to read the next
line, "<em>Humph</em>, Go to thy cold bed, and wärm thee," which
occurs again in Lear (iii. 4). It may have been borrowed
from some unknown play; but there is nothing like it in
Kyd's Spanish Tragedy, which is evidently referred to in

</div></div>
</div>
<p>'Brach' cannot be right; for brach was bitch (see <a href="#Brach">Index</a>
<em>s. v.</em>), and what sportsman would say Bitch Sweet lips, for instance,
of one of his hounds? In the usual manner the
printer was led away by the 'brach' in the following line.
The original word must have been a verb, and, were we not
aware of what critics usually are, we might wonder at Johnson's
most simple and natural emendation, <em>Bathe</em> not being
universally adopted. In his whole speech the lord shows
his affection for his hounds; for the charge about coupling
Clowder with another hound is evidently owing to his being
united to an ill-conditioned dog. Poor Merriman, it is
plain, had got a swelling in the leg or elsewhere&mdash;for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
is the only possible meaning of 'emboss'd' in this place;
so when the Prince (1 Hen. IV. iii. 3) calls Falstaff
an "<em>embossed</em> rascal," he means swollen up&mdash;the proper
remedy for which was <em>bathing</em> or fomenting with warm
water; and this he directs to be done. But Mr. Collier
tells us that "a <em>dog</em> or a deer is said to be <em>embossed</em> when
fatigue makes them foam at the mouth;" from which all
that can be inferred is that Mr. Collier is no sportsman;
for any one who has been out with hounds knows that when
fatigued they pant and put out their tongues, but <em>never</em>
foam. Shakespeare, who apparently knew something of
hunting, has correctly, "<em>Lolling</em> the tongue with slaughtering"
(Cymb. v. 3), alluding to hounds. On the other hand,
Mr. Dyce most confidently reads <em>Trash</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, put a "heavy
collar, strap or rope dragging loose on the ground" on him
to check his speed. I fear that Mr. Dyce is no sportsman
either. At least at the present day hounds do not carry
weight; for that, I suppose, is what he means. He probably
understood 'emboss'd' in the same sense as Mr. Collier.
I adopt Johnson's reading, though aware that in cases of this
kind (Introd. p. <a href="#Page_65">65</a>) we should not look for any similarity
of form (Mr. Dyce's <em>ductus literarum</em>) in the word to be substituted.
(See on Othel. iii. 3.) Here, for example, we
might read <em>Mind</em>, or some other word.</p>

<p>The 2nd folio adds <em>yes</em>, Malone <em>them</em>, Dyce <em>guests</em> after
'invite'; my own conjecture was <em>aye</em>. Would it not be
better, however, to read as I have done, "Make friends <em>be</em>
invite<em>d</em>, and proclaim the banns"? There is an exactly
similar omission of <em>be</em> in All's Well, i. 3, where there can
be no doubt. We might also read simply 'friends invite<em>d</em>';

invite friends <em>too</em> and proclaim the banns," which would
agree better with the character of the speaker.</p>

Dictionary "<em>Angelot à la grosse escaille</em>. <em>An old
Angel</em>, and by metaphor a fellow of the old, sound, honest,
and worthy stamp." But how could Biondello know his
character? Some read <em>engle</em>, properly <em>ingle</em>; but this is
rather, comrade, bosom-friend. In Gascoigne's Supposes,
from which this part of the play is taken, he is termed
"good soul," and it may be that the poet's word here was
<em>uncle</em>&mdash;the conjecture also of a Mr. Bubier, in the Cambridge
Edition&mdash;a term used of elderly persons. (See Index <em>s. v.</em>
<a href="#Nuncle">Nuncle</a>.) Just afterwards he is said to be "surely like a father"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Here is what seems to be a convincing proof of the effacement
of the ends of lines in the MS. In the second line the
2nd folio inserted <em>sir</em> in the middle, and in the third it read
'<em>most</em> ready and <em>most</em> willing.' Lower down the ends of
two lines more have been also effaced.</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>'Your son' belongs to first line; and as we have had
(iii. 2) "And marry sweet Bianca with consent," we might
complete the metre by reading 'with <em>my full</em> consent'; but
it is more probable, as this page of the MS. appears to have
been injured, that the loss was at the end. I read of <em>me,
Baptista</em>, as (v. 1) we have "mine only son and heir to the
lands of <em>me, signior Vincentio</em>." In the next line 'know' is
most probably a mere printer's error. I have in my Edition,
given <em>hold</em>, the reading of Collier's folio; but I think now
that the right word is <em>trow</em>, which occurs more than once in
Shakespeare in the sense of think, and which I find was also
the conjecture of Hanmer.</p>

<p>Surely 'temple' has no meaning here. Must not the
poet have written <em>table</em>. In Lucrece (st. 168), in the Var.
Shakespeare, "Her sacred <em>temple</em>" is printed "Her sacred
<em>table</em>." I am not aware that any critic has observed this
palpable error. The term 'table,' it may be observed, was
much more used by our forefathers than by us. Thus in
The Elder Brother (iii. 4) Miramont says to his brother,
"May be I'll see your <em>table</em> too," <em>i.e.</em> be of your dinner-party.</p>

<p>Unless we take it ironically&mdash;which is unworthy of the

Walker <em>gipsy</em>&mdash;both bad. I read, with the utmost confidence,

Lead in fact never is pale; for its surface is always oxydized.
Shakespeare, moreover, would hardly use the same term of
two distinct substances. (See, however, on Rom. and Jul. ii.

<p>The original editions all read "Cannot contain their urine

cannot but adhere to <em>stint your</em> for 'think you,' as I have

and more suited to the calm resignation of Antonio; while
in the other reading there is something of sneer or irony that
is unpleasant. Nothing was easier than for the printer to
read <em>stint</em>, the more unusual term, as <em>think</em>, and then to make

<p>As the Duke proceeds to show that he <em>did</em> feel this difference,
the text cannot be right. Critics, therefore, for 'not'
read <em>but</em>, as these words were frequently confounded by the
printers. But then a question arises, was 'the season's difference'
any part of 'the penalty of Adam.' In Scripture
that penalty was "in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread;" and this was the very penalty that the Duke and his
friends did not feel; for we have just been told of them (i. 1)
that "they fleet away the time carelessly, as they did in the
Golden World." Further, it does not appear that any
writer anterior to Milton made the Ovidian change of seasons
a part of Adam's penalty. The text may therefore be
right, and a line, something like this, have been lost,</p>

<p>It is quite impossible that this line in its present form
could have come from the pen of the poet. He must have
seen the absurdity of dying before living, and he could have
had no motive for departing from the universal form "live
and die," as in "I could live and die in the eyes of Troilus"
(Tr. and Cr. i. 2). If we then transpose, and take 'by' in the
sense of beside, near, in contact with (<a href="#By">Index</a> <em>s. v.</em>), we get excellent
sense. 'Dies,' however, may be a printer's error for
some other verb&mdash;<em>sheds</em> perhaps; and then 'by' may be
taken in its ordinary sense. I had also, like Heath, conjectured
'<em>daily</em> lives.'</p>

<p>The transposition in the first line removes all necessity

Shakespeare wrote it." Coleridge thus expresses the same

times by Spenser, Chapman, and others; and we have,
"Noble heróes, my sword and yours are kin" (All's Well,
ii. 1). The metre excludes <em>héroes</em>. Theobald, followed by
Dyce, read <em>mynheers</em>, not a Shakespearian term; Steevens <em>on

the 4tos, as well as of the folio; and as the first 4to and the

likely that two transcribers or printers should have fallen

<hr class="tb" />
<h5><span class="smcap">Sc. 5.</span></h5>
<p>Among the characters given in the heading of this
scene, we meet Mrs. Quickly and Pistol; the 4tos have
"Mrs. Quickly, like the Queen of Fairies," and prefix <em>Quic.</em>
to the following speeches, and it is not said that Anne was
to assume that character. The folio heads the speeches
with <em>Qui.</em> and <em>Qu.</em> We may therefore say that the poet was
oblivious when, in iv. 4. 6, he said that Anne should "present
the Fairy Queen;" for throughout she only appears as
an ordinary fairy, as is plain by the mistake made by Caius
and Slender. The poet seems to have confined the speaking
to the elder persons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"You moonshine-revellers, and shades of night,</div>
<div class="i0">You orphan-heirs of fixed Destiny."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>No one has been able to make any sense of 'orphan-heirs,'
which may therefore be treated as a corruption. Warburton
read '<em>ouphen</em>-heirs,' which Singer adopts; but there is no
such word as <em>ouphen</em>. My own opinion is that the poet
wrote <em>ouphes and</em> heirs; and as in general the <em>d</em> in <em>and</em> is
not pronounced, even before vowels, and the <em>ou</em> might easily
be mistaken for <em>or</em>, the printer made <em>orphan</em>. The line, we
may see, thus forms a parallel to the preceding line. The
poet seems to have used 'heirs' in the sense of children.
In Fletcher's Mad Lover we have,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Coarse and base appetites, earth's mere inheritors,</div>
<div class="i0">And <em>heirs</em> of idleness and blood." (ii. 1.)</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>In favour of my reading, it may be observed that in iv. 4
and in the following speeches the Ouphes occur, as well as
the Elves and Fairies, and nowhere else in Shakespeare.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">

<div class="i0">Cricket to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap;</div>
<div class="i0">What fires thou findest unraked and hearths unswept."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The rime shows that 'toyès' is a dissyllable. In 'unswept'
the <em>t</em> should not be sounded, and, I think, not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
printed. <em>Unswep</em> is merely the apocopated part, of which
examples are so numerous in our language; it is like <em>kep</em>,
<em>crep</em>, etc., which, though regarded now as vulgarisms, are
grammatically correct. Collier's folio, followed by Mr.
Collier and others, reads '<em>when</em> thou<em>'st</em> leap<em>'d</em>,' a mere result
of ignorance of grammar.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"To repay that money will be a biting affliction."</div>

</div>
<p>I have, after Theobald, added here from the 4tos the
following lines, of which, however, he did not give the
last:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"<em>Mrs. Ford.</em> Nay, husband, let that go to make amends,</div>
<div class="i0">Forgive that sum and so we'll all be friends.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Ford.</em> Well, here's my hand; all is forgiven at last.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>Fal.</em> It hath cost me well. I've been well pinch'd and wash'd."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The play is thus made to end more agreeably, and Falstaff
can accept the invitation to supper with a better grace.
These lines, it is true, rime, and so are not quite in harmony
with the other speeches, whence it seems to follow that the
omission was made by the poet. But his judgement in this
case must have fallen asleep; for Ford had no right to be so
hard on the poor knight, as he had given him the money,
or rather we might say forced it on him. As to the rime,
we have two other couplets toward the end of the play.</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>As a sound breathing is pure nonsense, Pope read <em>south</em> for
'sound'; and, with the exception of Mr. Knight and Mr.
Staunton, all the editors, I believe, have followed him. Yet
even this correction does not remove the difficulty, for <em>south</em>
alone, no more than <em>north</em>, <em>east</em>, or <em>west</em>, is never used of the
wind. It seems to me then that the poet wrote <em>south wind</em>,
and as the <em>th</em> was usually suppressed in <em>south</em>, <em>north</em>, etc., as
<em>sou'-west</em>, <em>sou'-east</em>, the printer pronounced <em>sou wind</em> or, it
may be, <em>sou 'ind</em>, which easily became 'sound' in his mind,
and so he printed it. (See Introd. p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>.) It is rather remarkable
that this very correction is made by an <em>Anon.</em> in
the Cambridge Shakespeare. The same idea, I may observe,
occurs in the Antonio and Mellida of Shakespeare's contemporary,
Marston (Act I.):</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">"Smile heaven and softest southern wind</div>
<div class="i0">Kiss her cheek gently with perfumed breath."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Both were probably indebted to "Her breath is more sweet
than a gentle south-west wind, that comes creeping over
flowery fields and shadowed waters" in Sidney's Arcadia.
For a similar omission of <em>wind</em>, see on Temp. i. 2.</p>

<p>This is Pope's correction of 'dam'd coloured' of the folio.
Knight reads <em>damask</em>; Collier's folio <em>dun</em>, which is very bad
indeed. We meet in other dramatists with <em>straw-</em>, <em>peach-</em>, <em>carnation-colour'd</em>
stocks. It is perhaps impossible to recover
the right word, yet I see little objection to <em>flame-colour</em>;
for if we suppose <em>flame</em> pronounced as in Latin and French
(see Introd. p. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>), <em>flame-coloured</em> might easily become
'damn'd (pr. <em>dam</em>) coloured' in the printer's mind. In
confirmation we have elsewhere in the folio '<em>scar</em>-crow,' not
'<em>scare</em>-crow,' and other like words.</p>

play would also justify Malone's reading, as guardians were
not always willing to part with dowers in their hands.
Perhaps for 'of <em>a</em> dower' we should read 'of <em>her</em> dower,'
for the <em>h</em> in <em>her</em> not being pronounced, and the <em>r</em> but slightly,
the printer might easily make the mistake; so also 'coffer'
should probably be 'coffers.'</p>

<p>We have a similar sentiment in Cymb. v. 1. As <em>of ice</em>
and <em>of vice</em> are pronounced exactly alike, we may safely
assume the latter to be the true reading. The whole difficulty
then lies in 'brakes.' A brake was certainly, as we
are told, a frame to confine restless or vicious horses in when
shoeing; but when it is added that it is also an instrument
of torture, I become somewhat dubious. At any rate no
one would say a rack or a gibbet of vice; so why a brake of
vice? I incline then, but with hesitation, to think that we
should read <em>wreaks o' vice</em>. We have "wreak the love"
(R. and J. iii. 5); "wreak our wrongs." (Tit. And. iv. 3.)
I put the ambiguous <em>o'</em>, because <em>wreak</em> takes <em>on</em> rather than

there is no very great objection; but as elsewhere (Cor. iv.

<div class="i0">If not a fedary but only he,</div>
<div class="i0">Owe and succeed thy weakness."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>"A very obscure passage," says Mr. Dyce, "in which
Rowe printed '<em>by</em> weakness,' and Malone proposes '<em>this</em>
weakness.' (On 'fedary' see Richardson's Dictionary, <em>sub</em>
Federal.)" And this is all this noted critic has to say! For
my part I do not regard this passage as by any means past
cure, and I think that Warburton came very near the true
sense. The main point is to ascertain the exact meaning of
<em>fedary</em>. "<em>Federy</em> and <em>federary</em>," says Richardson, "in
Shakespeare are the same word differently written (having
no connexion whatever with <em>Feud</em> or <em>Feudatory</em>), and signify
a colleague, associate, or <em>confederate</em>;" and he refers to
Minshew, <em>s. v.</em> Feodarie. Now Minshew's words are "Feodarie
<em>alias</em> Feudaris <em>alias</em> Feudatrie, Feudelarius, is an office
authorized by the Master of the Court of Wards and Liveries
by letters patent, and under the seal of that office," etc.
Cotgrave has "A feodarie, <em>feudal</em>, <em>feodal</em>, <em>feudataire</em>;" in
both of which places I think the "connexion with <em>Feud</em> and
<em>feudatory</em>" is very apparent; and the last convinces me that
a <em>fedary</em> or <em>feodary</em> was a vassal, a liegeman; and that, I have
no doubt, is its sense in this place? and in Cymb. iii. 2, where
it again occurs, as I shall there show. I do not think
Richardson was at all justified in making, as he seems to do,
<em>fedary</em> a different word from <em>feodary</em>. There was also <em>feodar</em>
a vassal, "For seventeen kings were Carthage <em>feodars</em>."
(Marston. Sophon. Prol.) It must strike every one of taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
with surprise that Shakespeare should have written such a
leonine verse as</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"If not a fedary, but only he."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>And further, whether 'fedary' be vassal or confederate, the
person should be mentioned to whom he stood in that relation.
In the former sense&mdash;the only true one&mdash;that person
must be either Heaven or the Duke, which was omitted by
the printer. I am in favour of the former, both for metre-sake
and because we have elsewhere, "The rest of your <em>fees</em>,
O Gods! the senators of Athens" (Tim. iii. 5); and "God's
<em>vassals</em> drop and die" (Hen. V. iii. 2). I read thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"We are all frail.&mdash;<em>Isab.</em> Else let my brother die.&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">If not a fedary of <em>Heaven</em>, but only he,</div>
<div class="i0">Owe and succeed this weakness.... <em>Ang.</em> Nay, women are frail too."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Isabella replies at once, fully assenting to Angelo's observation.
After a brief pause, she is proceeding to reason on
the subject, when he interrupts her. We may observe that
'owe' and 'succeed' are legal terms, which here form a
hysteron-proteron, like some other common phrases. Perhaps,
indeed, we might transpose them; for Isabella is speaking
quite calmly and composedly. The change of 'thy' to
<em>this</em> is perfectly legitimate; and <em>to</em> may have been omitted or
effaced after 'succeed.'</p>

<p>No sense has been made of 'as aged,' which may therefore
be regarded as corrupt. As in Tr. and Cr. v. 3, <em>as lawful</em>

(also the reading of Mr. Staunton) in the sense of
dependent, in subjection, the ordinary state of youth under
the authority of parents and elders, depending on them for
money, etc. We might perhaps read <em>as gaged</em> in the same
sense, if we had examples. The Cambridge editors propose
<em>abased</em>, which is good, and might easily have become 'as
aged.' Possibly the poet wrote <em>an abject</em>, as we have, "We
are the Queen's <em>abjects</em>" (Rich. III. i. 1), and "I will make
thee stoop, thou <em>abject</em>" (Jonson, Ev. Man Out, etc., v. 3), "That
thou wilt never let me live to be <em>An abject</em>" (Chapman,

<p>It appears to me that a negative is required to make the

it is omitted in these plays. Here, however, I
think, 'a' has been printed in its place (see on Twelfth
Night, ii. 2), for the compositor probably did not pronounce

<p>It is the falcon, not the fowl, that is enmewed. Would
that every correction were as certain as that which I have
made here! I read, with the fullest confidence, <em>enew</em>. (See
<a href="#Enew">Index</a> <em>s. v.</em>) It is a most curious circumstance that in this
place of the MS. I unconsciously wrote <em>bud</em> for 'head,' a
correction which was afterwards given in Notes and Queries
(3rd S. v. 229), and had, I believe, been previously proposed
by Grey. If 'head' be the right reading, it may signify
the state of bloom. "That unmatch'd form and feature of
<em>blown</em> youth" (Ham. iii. 1).</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>So the passage stands in the folio. As there is no such
word known in English as 'prenzie,' the 2nd folio read
<em>princely</em>, Hanmer <em>priestly</em>, which Mr. Dyce adopts. I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
however, that the German Tieck hit on the right word, <em>precise</em>,
and I have so printed it without hesitation. We have
had already, "Lord Angelo is precise" (i. 4), "is severe"
(ii. 1), and "well-seeming" (iii. 1); but it is nowhere said
that he was <em>princely</em> or <em>priestly</em>, and surely the guards or
bindings of a dress could hardly be so termed. As to the
change of accent, which Mr. Dyce makes an objection, a
reader of our old poets should be ashamed to urge it, it is
of such frequent occurrence, and it occurs more than once
in this very play. In i. 2 we actually have "précise villains,"
and "A sort of sober, scurvy, precise neighbours"
(Jonson, Alch. i. 1). (See Introd. p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>.) I further think we
should read 'bodies,' and with Collier's folio <em>garbs</em>, which
being spelt <em>garbes</em> differs only in one letter from 'gardes.'
As the latter were mere bindings, edgings, facings, they
could hardly be said to cover a body. The infinitives 'invest'
and 'cover' are used (as so frequently) where we now
use a participle with an article. See Introd. p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>.</p>

more than one instance of <em>in</em> being effaced in the beginning

'to go,' are equivalent to <em>knowing</em>, etc. (See Introd. p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>.)

omitting 'To' in the third line we get excellent sense, and
what more need we require? After I had made this simple
emendation, I learned, to my great surprise&mdash;for the editors
gave no heed to it&mdash;that I had been anticipated in it by
Theobald. 'Draw' in the third line connects with 'may'
in the first; but the printer, taking 'practice' for a verb,
added 'To' to try to make sense. For 'making practice,'
see on All's Well, iv. 2. 'Likeness' is simulation: "Do
not assume my likeness," <em>i.e.</em> pretend to be like me. (Tim.

<p>The punctuation of the first line, which is that given by

<p>As 'combined' makes no good sense, we might read <em>constrained</em>.

<p>There is evidently something wrong here. What is the
meaning of 'dares?' Mr. Singer says overawes (as larks?),
and in proof of 'no' being crying No, he quotes: "I wear
a sword to satisfy the world no" (Fletch. Chances, iii. 4).
"I am sure he did it for I charged him no" (<em>Id.</em> Wife for
Month, iv. 3). In the next line Mr. Dyce reads <em>so</em>, others
<em>such</em>, for 'of.' My own decided opinion is, that in the first
line the poet wrote <em>saies</em> (says), which of course, being
written with a long <em>s</em> in the beginning, might easily be taken
for 'dares.' 'Says her no,' then, is forbids her, as in "Who
shall say me Nay?" (1 H. IV. iii. 1); "God defend his
Grace should say us Nay" (Rich. III. iii. 7); and in this
play (ii. 2), "Did I not tell thee Yea?" In the second line
I would omit 'of.' See on Rich. II. v. 1; Cymb. iii. 5.</p>

<em>sets</em> for 'lets' in "That lets it out, only for show or profit."
'Gest' (from <em>giste</em>, <em>gîte</em>, Fr.?) is used of the halting-places
on a royal progress. Singer quotes from Strype a request
from Cranmer to Cecil, "to let him have the new-resolved
upon <em>gests</em> from that time to the end, that he might know
from time to time where the king was." Hence it would
appear that there was a program of the gests, stating the
time of arrival at and departure from each of them. I have
therefore read 'gest-day,' supposing the last word, as usual,
to have been effaced. See Introd. p. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>.</p>

it be affection?" The whole passage is rather obscure.
'Affection' is imagination, fancy (see <a href="#Affection">Index</a> <em>s. v.</em>); and the

<p>This is probably the genuine text; but '<em>w</em>akes her blood.

</div>
<p>Grey proposed <em>Charm</em> for 'Clamour,' and in Othello (v. 2)
we have the very phrase, "charm your tongue." But, as far
as I have observed, <em>charm</em> in this sense is used only by characters
of the educated class. Singer says 'clamour' here
is a mere corruption of <em>chamour</em>, <em>chaumer</em>, or <em>chaumbre</em>, from
the French <em>chômer</em>, 'to refrain,' and he adds, "Mr. Hunter
has cited a passage from Taylor, the water-poet, in which
the word was thus again perverted:&mdash;'<em>Clamour</em> the promulgation
of your tongue.'" For my own part I think that,
except in orthography, the text is right. The real word
was probably <em>clammer</em> or <em>clemmer</em>, the same as the simple
<em>clam</em> or <em>clem</em>, to squeeze or press, and the phrase answers to
<em>Hold your tongues</em>. "To <em>clam</em> a bell," says Johnson, "is to
cover the dapper with felt, which drowns the blow and
hinders the sound." As for the extract from Taylor, I
attach little importance to it, as he probably adopted the
word from this very passage. See on Rom. and Jul. iii. 3.</p>

<p>As the epithets are here most inappropriate, we should
probably transpose them, as I have done (see on iv. 1); for
heath is brown, and "they were in a clump or cluster of
<em>tall furze</em>," says Scott (Redgauntlet, ch. xvi.). We might
also transpose the substantives (see on Twelfth Night, i. 2,
and on M. N. D. ii. 1). Hanmer proposed to read "<em>Ling</em>,
heath, <em>broom</em>, furze;" and this reading Mr. Dyce adopts;
but <em>ling</em> was probably a word unknown to the poet, and it
is only another name for heath.</p>

<p>As the plural of 'princess' does not occur in Shakespeare,
and a plural seems required here, I suspect that 'princess'
may be a collective. (See Introd. p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>.) For 'hours' we might

</div></div>
</div>
<p>I make the transposition of "So have we all&mdash;of joy," in
the second line boldly; for surely neither Shakespeare nor
any other writer would put a parenthesis between a noun
and its genitive. Gonzalo is speaking quite calmly, and
without any perturbation. We have an exactly similar
printer's error in</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>The word 'merchant' occurs here in two different senses;
and when this play was written Shakespeare had long since
abstained from such practices. One of them, therefore, must
belong to the printer; if the first, then we might, and I think
should, read <em>vessel</em>, if the second, <em>owner</em>. 'Merchant' certainly
occurs in the sense of merchantman. See B. and F. Coxcomb,

</div>
<p>The editors in general read, with Malone, <em>she'd</em> for 'should';
but surely she was not the balance. We get very good sense
by omitting either 'at' or 'o'; in my Edition I have, as
Pope had done, omitted the latter; for <em>o</em>', or <em>of</em>, was sometimes
added by the printers. (See on M. for M. iv. 4.)
'Weigh'd' is pondered.</p>

<p>It is very strange that none of the editors should have
seen that the negative had been effaced or omitted. Surely
the very last thing that Antonio could have wished was that
he should hear them; and how could he if he went to sleep?
<em>Not</em>, we may also see, is required by the metre. The latter

<p>Though in my Edition I have not altered the text, I think
we should read 'from whom <em>coming</em>' with Singer; 'we

</div>
<p>I must confess I do not clearly understand this passage.
Surely as he was, as he had just said, in actual possession of
Milan, his conscience could not 'stand' between him and
it. Perhaps, however, we are to view 'stand' as in the
conjunctive mood, and expressing a condition. Neither do

<p>The first line here is short, which it should not be, as it

<p>We should perhaps read <em>on</em> for 'of'; or, with Thirlby and
Malone, transpose 'five' and 'one,' of which both Gifford
and Dyce approved. Yet it may be that no change is necessary,
for <em>of</em> and <em>on</em> are constantly used interchangeably, and
<em>o</em>' stands for both. The 'of' of the text may, however,
have been caused by the initial letter of the following word.</p>

<p>Mr. Dyce properly rejects this arrangement, but on the last

this arrangement is, that in this play Shakespeare does

</div></div>
</div>
<p>For 'third,' which might easily have been a printer's
error for <em>thrid</em>, i.e. <em>thread</em>, editors in general follow Theobald
in reading this last word. It is easy to conceive how
Miranda might be regarded as a thread or integral portion
of her father's life, but not how she could be a <em>third</em> of it.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>
<p>Of course Shakespeare wrote 'of her.' The editors, without,
I believe, an exception, have 'boast her <em>off</em>'&mdash;a phrase
unknown to the poet&mdash;introduced by the editor of the 2nd

<p>As it is difficult to make any good sense here of 'can'

making 'Genius' a trisyllable, and the line of six feet.</p>

<div class="i0">"Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>'Banks' may be either the margins of streams or hillocks,
or slight elevations of land; but 'brims,' which can only be
the edges or margins of hollows, shows that it is the former
that is meant. 'Pioned' seems to be a word of Shakespeare's
own creation; for, finding the word <em>pioneer</em> in common
use, and <em>pyonings</em>&mdash;a word of Spenser's coinage&mdash;in the
Faerie Queen (ii. 10. 63) signifying defences, the work of
pioneers, he thought himself at liberty to form a verb <em>pion</em>.
This is generally taken to mean <em>dig</em>; and 'twilled' is supposed
to be a term transferred from cloth, etc., and signifying
<em>ridged</em>; and so the passage is made to mean dug, and laid
out in ridges, which, however, hardly accords with the context.
Steevens, on the other hand, read 'pioned and <em>lilied</em>';
but neither the piony nor the lily can properly be regarded
as a wild flower (though the former is said to grow on the
Severn), and such only could be meant here. Others again for
'twilled' read <em>tilled</em>, or give strange meanings to 'twilled.'
My own opinion is, that the sense which Shakespeare gave
to his 'pioned' was fenced, and that 'twilled' was a
printer's error. We may observe that 'and twilled' is pronounced
<em>an twilled</em>, which differs very slightly in sound from
'<em>and willow'd</em>.' (See Introd. p. <a href="#Page_52">52</a>.) By reading, then, "Thy
banks with pioned and willow'd brims" we get most excellent
sense, the idea in the poet's mind being the bank of a
stream, fenced, as it were, and secured against overflow, with
a range of willows along its edge, and 'betrimmed,' <em>i.e.</em>
adorned, with primroses, violets, and other wild flowers;
for "April showers bring forth May flowers." I have not
hesitated to make this correction in my Edition.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>
<p>In my Edition I have here transposed the adjectives (See
on i. 1). We are to take 'cold,' as so frequently, in the sense
of cool, which agrees well with flowers growing on the edge
of a stream, while it seems absurd to term them 'chaste.'
'Nymphs' is evidently maidens; for if the Naiades were
meant there would be an article.</p>

<p>For 'broom' Hanmer read <em>brown</em>, which I have adopted;
though contrary to my rule (see Introd. p. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>), as I have met
no earlier authority for this use of <em>brown</em> than Milton. The
poet's word may have been <em>broad</em> or <em>trim</em>. The broom
never attains a height to justify the terming it a 'grove.'
Dyer, a good authority, has in his Fleece "<em>low-tufted</em>
broom," and Bloomfield (Rural Tales) "<em>tufts</em> of green
broom," both using the proper term. I doubt if 'grove'
is ever used of any but forest-trees.</p>

</div>
<p>No one has ever made, or can make, sense of this. For
'Spring' Collier's folio reads <em>Rain</em>&mdash;no great improvement.
The fact is, as the context plainly shows, that the poet's
word was <em>Shall</em>. With this simple change the whole passage
becomes clear and grammatical, and forms a parallel to
the fairy-blessing at the end of Mids. Night's Dream.</p>

<p>As Shakespeare had read, in the Faerie Queen, of Night

<p>For 'convicted' I read <em>conflicted</em>, i.e. dashed, or dashing

<p>I read '<em>in</em> my fear.' We have <em>Is</em> for <em>In</em> also in Jul. Cæs.
i. 3; the same confusion of these words occurs more than
once in Chaucer. I have often met with it in books printed

</div></div>
</div>
<p>As it is plain, from what went before, that they should not
have that effect, editors have made a transposition of 'then'
and 'should.' It seems to me, however, that here, as in so
many other places, the printer omitted the negative after
'should.' I do not perfectly understand 'rest' in the preceding
line, but it may be tranquillity, tranquil, undisturbed
possession, a sense it bears in Scripture. See Ps. xcv. 11,

<p>This is the merest prose. Ritson for <em>ask</em> repeats 'demand

<em>of</em>,' making 'Marshal' a trisyllable, as the King of course
speaks in a solemn, majestic tone. In 1 Hen. VI. iv. 7, an
envoy says: "Great märshal to Hen<em>e</em>ry the Sixth." In Hen.

</div>
<p>So this place is pointed in the original and subsequent
editions, making little or no sense. I punctuate&mdash;'As the
last taste of sweets is sweetest&mdash;last'; in which I find I had
been anticipated by Mason. The passage is one of the poet's
obscurest. His meaning is that the concluding part of any
impression on the senses is the most permanent in its effect
on the mind; but how strangely expressed!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"As praises of his state. Then there are found</div>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>The two earliest 4tos read: "As praises, of whose taste

<div class="center">

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>There seems hardly to be any doubt that 'rag'd,' to

suggested by 'rage.' We might read <em>curb'd</em> or, with Ritson,

<p>From Malone's note it would seem quite plain that a line

<p>It means probably of the time of absence; but it is very

</div>
<p>It is plain that something has been lost here; it may be
a line, but I think the slight addition I have made, and in
the very place where the loss was most likely to occur, removes
all difficulty. "The air of Paradise did <em>fan</em> the
house" (All's Well, iii. 2). The poet had in his mind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Prince's plume, which he supposes to have been worn by his
companions also; and it is quite evident&mdash;or else there is no
force in the comparison&mdash;that he also supposed that it was
on his head the ostrich carried his long bending feathers.
So Drayton also: "The Mountfords all in plumes, like
ostriches were seen" (Polyolb. xxii.). The following line
of Tasso gives us the exact image:&mdash;"E <em>ventolar</em> sui gran
cimier le penne" (Ger. Lib. xx. 28). Hanmer read '<em>and</em> with
the wind.' Rowe, who has been generally followed, read
<em>wing</em> for 'with'; but the verb <em>wing</em> has but one sense in the
poets, to fly, and the ostrich no more flies than the greyhound.
Mr. Dyce, however, adopts this reading, which, he says,
"affords a clear and good meaning," and he quotes in support
of it these lines of Claudian, who, he thinks may, as a
native of Egypt, be speaking as an eye-witness:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Vasta velut Libyæ venantum vocibus ales</div>
<div class="i0">Cum premitur calidas cursu transmittit arenas,</div>

<div class="i0">Pulverulenta volat."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">In Eutrop. ii. 310.</p>

<p>But surely this is sailing with, not winging the wind; and
what has it to do with 'plum'd'? I very much doubt if
Claudian ever saw an ostrich running; for that was only to
be seen in the desert, which Egyptians rarely visited at any
period.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Baited like eagles having lately bath'd."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>I know no sense of the verb <em>bait</em> that will give any tolerable
meaning here. To read 'Bated,' as is usually done,
from <em>bate</em>, to flap the wings, gives merely a ridiculous sense.
I have a strong persuasion that the poet's word was <em>Beated</em>,
a term which he also uses in Son. lxii., where, by the way,
the critics seem not to have understood it. <em>Bete</em>, <em>beat</em>, <em>beath</em>,
is to kindle, heat, dry; and the idea in the poet's mind seems
to have been that of eagles, after refreshing themselves by
bathing, sitting on rocks for the sun to dry their plumage.
To these he likens the young knights, fresh and vigorous,
sitting on their war-steeds, under the beams of the sun.
Hence he goes on to say "Glittering," etc.</p>

<p>What the poet seems to mean is, that the billows though

their slippery nature, but fell back into the sea. <em>Shrouds</em>,
the reading of Collier's folio, seems poor and trivial.</p>

make so sudden a transition.</p>

<hr class="section" />

<h4><span class="smcap">Act IV.</span></h4>
<h5><span class="smcap">Sc. 1.</span></h5>
<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rage</div>
<div class="i0">And countenanc'd by boys and beggary."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
There may be some doubt about 'bloody'; for 'rage'
Sidney Walker and Collier's folio read <em>rags</em>, which seems
confirmed by the following line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>For 'graves' Warburton and Hanmer read <em>glaives</em>,
Steevens, <em>greaves</em>. Neither of these words occurs in Shakespeare,
and I rather suspect that the poet's word was <em>braves</em>,
<em>i.e.</em> bravadoes, boasts. "I will not bear these <em>braves</em> of
thine" (Tam. of Shr. iii. 1). "Now where's the Bastard's
<em>braves</em>?" (1 Hen. VI. iii. 2).</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"And are enforc'd from our most quiet there."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>For 'there' Warburton read <em>sphere</em>; perhaps we might
read <em>haven</em>. But, as in Lear (i. 1) we have "Thou losest
<em>here</em> a better <em>where</em> to find," 'there' is probably the poet's
word, both it, <em>here</em> and <em>where</em> being used as nouns signifying
place.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"My brother-general the commonwealth ...</div>
<div class="i0">To brother-born a household cruelty</div>
<div class="i0">I make my quarrel in particular."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The second line is not in the folio, and there may be, as
some critics think, a line lost; but my punctuation removes
all difficulty. We have only to understand <em>makes his quarrel</em>;
yet how strangely critics have puzzled over this not very
difficult passage! We should perhaps read 'generals'; for
Hastings and Bardolph seem to have equal authority with
Mowbray. Lord Scroop had been put to death at Bristol,
1 Hen. IV. i. 3.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"And bless'd and grac'd, and did more than the king <em>affect</em>."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Thirlby conjectured <em>indeed</em> for 'and did.' I rather think
there was, as usual, an effacement at the end of the line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">"Every thing set off</div>
<div class="i0">That might so much as think you enemies."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>This is a strange use of 'think'; we should perhaps read
<em>hint</em>, were it not that this verb does not occur in Shakespeare.</p>

<div class="i0">"And present execution of our wills</div>
<div class="i0">To us and to our purposes confin'd."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>For 'confin'd' Hanmer read <em>confirm'd</em>; Johnson, <em>consign'd</em>.
I confess I do not clearly understand the passage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"That were our royal faiths martyrs in love."</div>

<div class="i0"><em>Such</em> dainty and such picking grievances."</div>

</div>
<p>I think it was thus the poet wrote, but that <em>such</em> was
effaced and then 'of' transposed on account of the metre.</p>

<p>I would read <em>seal</em>, in which I am supported by Sidney
Walker and Collier's folio. In iv. 1 we have</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>This is nonsense, produced in the usual way (Introd. p.
<a href="#Page_64">64</a>). Tyrwhitt proposed '<em>my</em> friends,' <em>i.e.</em> those who are
regarded as such. For the first 'my friends,' we may read

</div>
<p>This last line is difficult. By 'ragged' seems to be meant
mean, unworthy, paltry; or it may be the same as <em>rugged</em>, and
denote the roughness with which his application would be
received; and by 'forestall'd' what has been anticipated,
prevented by the efforts of his enemies. Massinger uses
<em>forestall'd remission</em> twice apparently in this sense: Duke of

in all, and all in every part" (Drayton, Mortim. 1596); "tota
in toto, et tota in qualibet parte" (Ph&oelig;nix Nest, 1593)&mdash;all
of the soul. Shakespeare may have read most or all of these
passages.</p>

<p>Here 'Linger' is a causative verb. (Introd. p. <a href="#Page_71">71</a>). Editors,
in their ignorance of the meaning of 'digest,' to regulate,
arrange, read <em>well</em>. By 'abuse of distance' is meant the
abuse we make of it by transporting the audience from one
country to another. For 'force a play,' which makes no
sense, and to complete the measure, I read '<em>as we</em> forge our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
play,' <em>as we</em> being, I am almost certain, the omitted words;
<em>forge</em> is frequent in the sense of shape, form. The confusion
of <em>our</em>&mdash;the <em>r</em> being hardly sounded&mdash;and <em>a</em> was natural; it
occurs again, I think, in 2 Hen. VI. iv. 1. At the end of this

</div></div>
</div>
<p>The folio reads 'and <em>a table</em> of green fields'; the text is
the correction of Theobald, which has been universally accepted;
yet <em>talkt</em> would come nearer to <em>table</em> than 'babbled,'
and it also better suits the metre; in which I find I had been
anticipated by an Anon. <em>ap.</em> Theobald. The Dame afterwards
says he "<em>talked</em> of the Whore of Babylon." Collier's
folio reads 'for his nose was as sharp as a pen <em>on</em> a table of
green <em>freeze</em>,' which is ingenious, but nothing more. The
nib of a pen in such a situation is usually black, and so does
not strike the eye. 'A table of green <em>fells</em>' has also been
conjectured. It has been supposed that Falstaff's mind was
wandering, and so may have reverted to his youthful days
in the country. But may not he, who must have been a
man of some education, have been repeating the 23rd Psalm
(so well suited to one in his condition), in which are the
words "He maketh me to lie down in <em>green pastures</em>"?</p>

<p>So the name was written evidently by the poet, and

of which Sidney Walker has given examples, though none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>

'faïr,' as more suited to the slow <em>chaffing</em> tone of Gloster:
"Of foür hoürs long. I must endure all." Fletch. Chances,
i. 6.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Why strewest thou sugar on that bottel'd spider?"</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>This is the orthography of the folio; the 4tos read here
<em>botled</em>, but in iv. 4 as the folio. Now as <em>bottled</em> has, as far
as my knowledge extends, but one sense, and one which
would give no meaning here, it may be intended to show
that the verb comes from <em>bottel</em> or <em>bottle</em> in the sense of truss,
bundle, as a bottle of hay or straw, a sense which it retains
in various compounds in the provincial dialects. 'Bottel'd
spider' would then answer to 'bunch-back'd toad' a few
lines further on. If this should not satisfy, we might read

<p>It might be better, though the meaning is the same, to

<p>Surely it was too <em>soon</em> or too <em>early</em>. This may, perhaps,

<p>There is evidently a syllable wanting after 'sleep'; and

be the most likely word. We might, perhaps, but with
loss of force, read <em>slumber</em> for 'sleep,' or 'Flourish and live';

the three last lines of the speech&mdash;which, it may be

<p>So the folio reads. Steevens and Malone read 'he

<p>'Papers' is here evidently a verb, as Pope saw, in the

Mr. Staunton proposes <em>paupers</em>, a verb equally unknown and

<h3>ROMEO AND JULIET.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Act I</span>.</h4>
<h5><span class="smcap">Sc. 1.</span></h5>
<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</div>
<div class="i0">Or dedicate his beauty to the same."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>This is the reading of all the old editions; but the correction
of Theobald, <em>sun</em> for 'same,' is so obvious and so natural
that I had made it long before I was aware I had been
anticipated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Why, <em>gentle cousin</em>, such is love's transgression."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>I make this insertion with confidence; for this is the only
speech in this play beginning with a short line not complementary
to the end of a preceding speech. In our poet's
plays of this period speeches never began with a short line,
unless when complementary, and at no time was the second
line of a couplet short. (Introd. p. <a href="#Page_82">82</a>.) Lower down (i. 5)
we have "Content thee, <em>gentle coz</em>, let him alone," where
the 4to, 1597, omits all but "let him alone."</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Being vexed, a sea nourish'd with lover's tears."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>As Johnson also saw, a line is lost here.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Tell me, in sadness, who she is you love."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>This is the reading of 4to 1597, which, however, has
'whom' (see Introd. p. <a href="#Page_59">59</a>). The other 4tos and the folios
read "who is that you love."</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"But sadly tell me who <em>she is you love</em>."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>These words seem evidently to have been lost; and the
repetition is very agreeable. Moreover in this play speeches
do not thus end with a short line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>A correction of Rowe's for <em>uncharm'd</em> of the originals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
<div class="i10">"Only poor,</div>
<div class="i0">That when she dies with beauty dies her store."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The plain meaning of this is, that beauty was 'her store,'
she had nothing but it, poor praise indeed from a lover! I
would read, with Theobald,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"That when she dies with her dies beauty store."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The meaning would then be that, as the whole store of
beauty lay, as it were, in her, by not marrying and transmitting
it to her children, she would cause it to die with
her, and would thus be poor as leaving nothing after her.
The same idea is expressed in the poet's first and following
sonnets: in Venus and Adonis we have&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,"</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>and other passages of a similar nature. See also Twelfth
Night, i. 5.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i10">"'Tis the way</div>
<div class="i0">To call hers, exquisite, in question more."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>This is not very intelligible. We might read 'her exquisite,'
or rather '<em>to</em> question.' To "call in question," in
Shakespeare always means, to express a doubt of. 'Question'
is examine, a word just used.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h5><span class="smcap">Sc. 2.</span></h5>
<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,</div>
<div class="i0">She is the hopeful lady of my earth."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Here a rime is lost, in consequence of the 'earth' of the
first line being in the printer's mind. There can be little
question, I should think, that the original word was not
'earth,' but <em>fee</em>, feud, fief, landed property, as in <em>knight's fee</em>,
<em>in fee</em>, etc., with which alone 'lady' accords. '<em>The</em> earth'
has long been the reading the first line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Which on more view of many&mdash;mine being one,</div>
<div class="i0">May stand in number, though in reckoning none" ...</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>This is the reading of both 4tos and folio, except 4to of 1597,
which reads "<em>Such amongst</em>." I should feel inclined to read
"Such <em>as on</em> view." By 'more' must be meant more extensive.
The aposiopesis, so suited to the hasty, impetuous
character of the speaker, makes all clear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
<div class="i0">"But in that crystal scales, let there be weighed</div>
<div class="i0">Your lady's love against some other maid."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>This is very oddly expressed; for it was the lady herself,
not her love, that was to be weighed. Theobald proposed
<em>lady-love</em>; but I doubt if that phrase was then in use. I
read '<em>lady and love</em>,' the &amp; of the MS. having been made s
by the printer, as it became <em>t</em> in 'meant' for 'mean <em>and</em>' in
All's Well, iv. 3.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Oh! then, I see, Queen Mab has been with you.</div>
<div class="i0"><em>Ben.</em> Queen Mab! What's she?</div>
<div class="i0"><em>Mer.</em> She is the fairies' midwife, etc."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>I think it best to read thus with 4to, 1597, adding <em>Mer.</em>
before 'She is.' Benvolio's question is evidently wanted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Of healths five fathom deep."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>It seems almost incredible that such a glaring absurdity
as this should have escaped a long succession of critics; and
yet I am not aware that any have noticed it. What is a
<em>health</em>? a wish, a moral idea, and how could that be 'five
fathom deep'? or be an object of terror to a soldier? It
may be said that it is the cup that is meant, but of this we
have no instance; and even if we had, Master Silence, who
was a man of peace, sings&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Fill the cup and let it come;</div>
<div class="i0">I'll pledge you a mile to the bottóm."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>So, as we may see, he was not, and why should a soldier
be, afraid of it? Malone quotes from Westward Hoe, 1607,
a passage in which we have drinking <em>fathom deep</em>, and it is
apparently drinking healths; but there is nothing about
terror in it, and it seems, no unusual circumstance, to have
arisen from the present line. In fine, something must have
been named that was a real object of terror to a soldier; and
I know no word so likely to have been used as <em>trenches</em>, which
might easily have been mistaken for 'healths.' In that
case the metric accent falling on 'five' would augment the
terror.</p>

<p>Mr. Dyce reads auburn, and he gives undoubted instances

to the general reading, first given by Upton, of <em>Adam</em>,
with an allusion to Adam Bell, the great archer; and I think
there may be another to Adam, the first man; for Shakespeare
may have known that in classic mythology Love was
the first of beings. There would be humour, then, in 'young
Adam' denoting the union of youth and age.</p>

We have elsewhere (Mer. of Ven. ii. 7) "<em>dull</em> lead." Moreover
lead is not pale, and the Nurse would seem to have
been rather a jolly, rubicund sort of woman; if <em>fare</em> be the
right reading, it would almost require <em>dull</em>. On the other
hand, we have in Chaucer (Tr. and Cr. ii), "With asshen
<em>pale as lede</em>," and (Dream) "That <em>pale</em> he wax as any <em>lede</em>."</p>

<div class="i0">Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Of 'runaway,' which cannot possibly be right, the
Cambridge edition enumerates no less than twenty-nine
various corrections! Warburton understood by it the sun;
Steevens, the night; Douce, Juliet; and a Mr. Halpen,
Cupid. Jackson, followed by Collier, read <em>unawares</em>. Mr.
Dyce conjectured <em>roving</em>, <em>soon day's</em>, and <em>rude day's</em>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
last he has placed in the text, but which seems to me to be
too young-ladyish for the ardent and <em>naïve</em> Juliet; and
moreover she had already called for the winking of day's eye,
<em>i.e.</em> for sunset. Some sense might also be made of <em>runagates</em>,
as persons wandering about by night, and still better of <em>runabouts</em>,
a word used by Marston (What you Will, iii. 1), and
which I have placed in the text, as making tolerable sense
and bearing resemblance to 'runaways.' Mr. Singer read
<em>rumourers</em>, against which little objection can be made. My
own opinion&mdash;to which I was led by Singer's reading, and
in which I find I had been anticipated by Heath and Mr.
Grant White&mdash;is, that the poet's word may have been
<em>Rumour's</em>. In the poem on which this play is founded,
Juliet, when pondering, before her marriage, on what might
be the consequence of admitting Romeo to a lover's privilege,
says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"So, I defil'd, <em>Report</em> shall take her trump of black defame,</div>
<div class="i0">Whence she, with puffed cheek, shall blow a blast so shrill</div>
<div class="i0">Of my dispraise, that with the noise Verona she shall fill."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Now Shakespeare may have wished to preserve this imagery,
and have substituted <em>Rumour</em> for <em>Report</em> for euphony's sake
and other causes. Rumour in effect seems to have been the
same as the classic Fame. In Sir Clyomen and Sir Clamydes,
a piece with which he was probably well acquainted, we
meet "Enter Rumour running," and this may have been in
his mind when he was writing the Induction to 2 Hen. IV.
In his other plays also he personifies both <em>rumour</em> and <em>report</em>,
as in</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"That pitiful Rumour may report my flight,</div>
<div class="i0">To consolate thine ear. Come night, end day;</div>
<div class="i0">For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">All's Well, iii. 2.</p>

<p>He may also have had these lines of Phaer's Virgil in his
mind:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"At night she [Fame] walks, nor slumber sweet doth take nor never sleeps,</div>
<div class="i0">By day on houses' tops she sits, and gates or towers she keeps,</div>
<div class="i0">On watching-towers she climbs, and cities great she makes aghast,</div>
<div class="i0">Both truth and falsehood forth she tells, and lies abroad doth cast."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
We may, then, fancy Juliet to suppose that Rumour was on
the watch to detect and expose her, and she wishes that the
gloom may be so intense that her eyes must wink perforce,
and so Romeo may leap to her arms unseen, and their union
remain undivulged. There may also have been intended a
play on the names Rumour and Romeo, like "My conceal'd
lady to our cancell'd love" (iii. 3). As Shakespeare undoubtedly
knew French, he may have had these lines of
Marot in his mind:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Car noire Nuict, qui des amants prend cure,</div>
<div class="i0">Les couvrira de sa grand robbe obscure;</div>
<div class="i0">Et si rendra cependant endormis</div>
<div class="i0">Ceux qui d'Amour sont mortelz ennemis."</div>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">"Till strange Love grow bold,</div>
<div class="i0">Think true love acted simple modesty."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Rowe, who has been followed by all, reads 'grow<em>n</em>,' and
he probably was right. Still, when we consider the joyous
perturbation of Juliet's mind, there may be an asyndeton,
and she may be speaking <em>allo staccato</em>. I have therefore, in
my Edition, left the text unaltered.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Sc. 3.</span></h5>
<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"A gentler judgement vanish'd from his lips."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>I have never met with any sense of 'vanish' but its ordinary
one, which certainly will not suit here. We should
therefore, I think, read <em>issued</em>, or some word of similar meaning.
It is curious that Massinger seems to have taken
'vanish'd' on Shakespeare's authority. "Upon those lips
from which those sweet words <em>vanish'd</em>" (Reneg. v. 5). We
have, however, in Lucrece:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"To make more vent for passage of her breath,</div>
<div class="i0">Which thronging through her lips, so <em>vanisheth</em></div>

<p>But the breath is material.</p>

<div class="i0">And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?"</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The folio, which gives the best text here, erroneously puts
the first of these lines after the third. The 4tos of 1599 and
1609 add most unnecessarily:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Flies may do this, but I from this must fly;</div>
<div class="i0">They are free men, but I am banished,"</div>

<h5><span class="smcap">Sc. 5.</span></h5>
<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>So the first 4to, which, with Mr. Dyce, I follow. The
other editions read:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay husband, friend."</div>

<div class="i0">"Villain and he be many miles asunder!</div>
<div class="i0">God pardon <em>him</em>! I do with all my heart."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>I have placed a (!) at the end of the first line; for Juliet
is evidently speaking here in the ambiguous manner of her
subsequent speeches. She means an indicative, but wishes
her mother to understand her in the optative mood. The
editors of the last century, not understanding this, have
without any authority changed 'be' to <em>are</em>. In the next
line <em>him</em> was added in the 2nd folio. I should be inclined
to make an <em>Aside</em> of 'I do with all my heart,' as she pretends
to plan his death. In the Globe Shakespeare the first line is
made an <em>Aside</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"My poor heart is so for a kinsman vex'd."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Both 4tos and folio&mdash;followed by all the editors&mdash;read
'Is my poor heart,' connecting it with the preceding 'dead.'
It is manifest they did not understand the ambiguous language
of Juliet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"To wreak the love I bore my cousin <em>Tybalt</em>."</div>
</div></div>

<p>The necessary addition was made in the 2nd folio.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
<div class="i0">"When the sun sets the earth doth drizzle dew."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The undated 4to reads <em>air</em>, and to talk of the earth drizzling
dew appears no doubt to be absurd; but expressions as
incongruous occur in these plays, and we have in Lucrece
"But as the <em>earth</em> doth <em>weep</em>, the <em>sun being set</em>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>I cannot conceive why the editors all read <em>settle</em>; for
'fettle,' <em>i.e.</em> prepare, make ready, is the reading of the 4tos
and folio.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>
<p>So I arrange this passage, in accordance with the old editions,
except the first 4to, the reading of which is different,
and is not verse at all. I omit 'time' as injurious to the
symmetry of the language; for the words in the first two lines

<p>In both places <em>flatter</em> seems to mean cheer, enliven. 'Eye'

<p>The 4to 1597 reads 'Under <em>this</em> yew-tree'; the others
'Under yond' <em>young</em> trees. Further on they all read 'As I

effaced in the MS.&mdash;is the reading of the 4tos, and is most
probably correct. (Introd. p. <a href="#Page_79">79</a>.) The editors of the folio,
not seeing any sense in 'Wrong,' read 'Roaming,' which
makes no sense at all; neither indeed does 'To wrong' make
a very good one. We might read&mdash;supposing the allusion
to be to a horse&mdash;<em>To run</em>, as in "You run this humour out
of breath" (Com. of Err. i. 1). In King John (ii. 1) we have
'roam' for <em>run</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>Theobald, who is usually followed, read <em>bawds</em> for 'bonds';
but surely <em>bawds</em> could not with any propriety be called
'sanctified and pious.' The truth is, the poet's word was
'bonds,' but the editors have not understood it, Singer, for
example, calling it <em>nonsense</em>. The whole passage is merely
a poetic periphrasis of seduction under promise of marriage;
and had the word been <em>Sounding</em>, not 'Breathing,' there
would probably have been no mistake.</p>

Here 'wake' is like <em>watch</em> (see Macb. ii. 2), sits up late.
In the next line I would for 'swaggering' read <em>staggering</em>.
'Upspring' is probably used collectively for the risers from
the table, a mode of expression not yet obsolete. "The

<p>This passage is not in the folio. As in 4to 1604, where

several other expressions; and this is almost a solitary instance
of the figurative use of 'sea' by our poet. <em>Assay</em>,
or <em>assays</em>, for 'a sea,' has also been proposed, "Galling the

<p>All the original 4tos read 'spendthrifts' (the passage is

<em>wasting</em>. "With sighs of love that cost the fresh blood dear"
(M. N. D. iii. 2), "Look pale as primrose, with blood-drinking

But can any one produce a single instance of Shakespeare's

connected by a <em>copula</em>, or forming a sentence like that in the

</div>
<p>This is the reading of the folio; the 4to 1622 has <em>crush</em>

and Dyce, read <em>brach</em> for 'trash.' These last-named critics
read the whole line thus: "If this poor <em>brach</em> of Venice
whom I <em>trash</em>." "The jingle," Steevens says, "being in
Shakespeare's manner." Now to this I object&mdash;first, that
this was not Shakespeare's manner, for the apparent instances
of it are mostly printers' blunders; and secondly, that
Roderigo did not require to be <em>trashed</em> or checked 'for his
quick hunting,' for he was always hanging back and ready
to give up the chase till urged on by Iago. This last objection
also applies to 'trace' in the sense of follow or accompany.</p>

<p>It would also apply, though in a less degree, to <em>train</em>, which

sneering ironical tone. As to 'brach,' though we frequently
find it used of a woman, I believe it was never applied to a
man.</p>

</div>
<p>The first 'keeps' was plainly produced, in the usual way,
by the second. Pope read <em>feels</em>, which was afterwards found
in 4to 1630, and is now generally received. Southern had
read <em>knows</em>, which seems equally good; and the same is the
reading of Collier's folio. I doubt much, however, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>

with 'keeps' in not personifying. <em>Feels</em> is evidently
a conjecture in 4to 1630, as well as by Pope, as having
some resemblance to 'keeps'; but in these cases no
resemblance need be sought. (See Introd. p. <a href="#Page_65">65</a>.) For 'icy'
Singer reads <em>yesty</em>, most needlessly.</p>

</div>
<p>This is the reading of the 4to; the folio has 'The' for
'A,' and '<em>and</em> moving' for 'unmoving.' For 'Time' Rowe,
who is generally followed, read <em>hand</em>; for 'slow unmoving'
Mason read 'slow<em>ly</em> moving'; Hunter read '<em>of</em> the Time for
scorn.' I, however, see no need of change. 'The Time of
scorn' is the scornful age or world, a frequent sense of 'time';
and we should print "To point his slow&mdash;unmoving finger
at," the latter term being a correction of the former.</p>

<p>For 'mad,' which is certainly wrong, Theobald read <em>bad</em>,

trivial, I read in my Edition <em>false</em>, as that is the term in the

'maid' in the preceding line.</p>

"a hot and fiery steed" (Rich. II. v. 2); or <em>angry</em>, as in
F. Q. i. 1, 1. I had, like M. Mason, conjectured <em>termagant</em>;
but that term is never applied to an animal. In favour of
<em>arrogant</em>, Singer quoted from the Arauco Domado of Lope de
Vega</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Y el <em>cavallo arrogante</em>, en que subido</div>
<div class="i0">El hombre parecia</div>
<div class="i0">Monstruosa fiera que seis pies tenia."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>In Spanish, I may observe, <em>caballo arrogante</em> is simply a gallant,
spirited horse. See Calderon, La Niña de Gomez Arias.
II. There is not, as far as I know, any instance of the use
of <em>arrogant</em> in this sense in English; and it would be a curious
circumstance if Shakespeare had learned the Spanish
sense of it.</p>

<div class="i0">"Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wand lip."</div>

</div>
<p>I see no sense in in 'wand.' Some editors read <em>wan'd</em>, taking
perhaps the image from the moon. I have read <em>wanton</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
in the sense of soft, yielding like "the wanton rushes"
(1 H. IV. iii. 1), "the wanton air" (L. L. L. iv. 3), which
would also suit the metre better. I, however, strongly suspect
that the poet's word may have been <em>tann'd</em>, spelt of
course <em>tand</em>, so that a printer's error was very obvious. She
is more than once called <em>gypsy</em>; she has "a <em>tawny</em> front"
(i. 1); and she says of herself (i. 5.) that she is "with
Ph&oelig;bus' amorous kisses <em>black</em>." In Son. cxv. we have
"<em>tan</em> sacred beauty;" and in Son. lxii.,</p>

<p>'Swell' (<em>sc.</em> with pride, <em>i.e.</em> are elate) no doubt makes

Perdita (W. T. iv. 3) is called 'enchantment,' both, however,

<p>How could the pure and gentle Cordelia suppose herself
to be suspected of murder? which, moreover, accords not
with the other charges she enumerates. Collier's folio reads

easily be taken for 'murder.'</p>

</div>
<p>It is strange that our critics have not seen that the
raven is figurative, and means the man. I find that the
German Delius had also perceived it. In the third line I
think we should read 'spirits of <em>evil</em>'; for a foot is wanting,
and good as well as evil spirits 'tend on mortal thoughts.'
The ordinary correction, 'Come, <em>come</em>,' is a mere make-shift,

<p>The word 'blanket' certainly seems too familiar and even
vulgar an expression, especially as the more dignified 'pall
thee' had just been used. Malone quotes from Drayton's
Mortemeriados, 1596, "The sullen night in misty <em>rug</em> is
wrapp'd." But even this is not so low as 'blanket.' Collier's
folio reads <em>blankness</em>, but that surely is whiteness.
Perhaps we might venture to read <em>blackness</em>, as in Ant. and
Cleop. (i. 4) we have "Night's <em>blackness</em>." At that time
'peep' was to gaze earnestly and steadily at anything; not
furtively, as now. 'To cry' in the next line may be crying.

<div class="i0">Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The second line here is short by a foot; and as it does not
end a paragraph, there must be something wrong. The defect,
however, is easily remedied; we have only to read,</p>

The structure of the last line is like that of "Thy knee
bussing the stones" (Cor. iii. 1). "The mind is its own
place" (Par. Lost, i. 254), and similar places. There can
be little doubt, I think, that <em>on't</em> was effaced at the end of
the third line; for the poet could hardly, even in his most
careless moment, have termed solid parts of a building
'pendent nests,' etc. Wordsworth, with this very place in
his mind, wrote: "<em>On</em> coigns of vantage <em>hang</em> their nests of
clay" (Misc. Son. 34). It is also in favour of this reading
that it throws the metric accent on <em>this</em>, thereby adding force.
'Coign of vantage' would seem to be <em>coin d'avantage</em>, Fr.,
and denoting a projection of some kind.</p>

<p>So the passage should be pointed. The first 'done' in
the first line is, finished, ended; from 'If' in the second line
to 'life to come' in the seventh is one sentence, with the
same idea repeated in three several forms, and not completed;
common sense dictates the transposition of 'surcease' and
'success,' the latter signifying accomplishment; 'but' in
lines four and six is, only; 'the life to come' is not the
future state but the remaining years of his own life, as is
manifest from what follows. In scene 5 we have had,
"Which shall to all our <em>nights and days to come</em>." We also
meet with, "True swains in love shall in the <em>world to

<p>For 'to Jove' most critics follow Mason in reading <em>to

occurs constantly in the sense of <em>at</em>, <em>chez</em>, <em>apud</em>: <em>ex. gr.</em>
"Being a great favourite <em>to</em> Queen Elizabeth" (Ashmole,
Hist. of Berkshire, i. 249). "My heart <em>to</em> her, but as guestwise

<p>Here one word appears, as elsewhere, to have become two
in the printer's hands. (See Introd. p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>.) But as the poet
was probably familiar with Chapman's Iliads, the allusion
may be to the various missions of Apollo, Minerva, Hermes,
and Iris.</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>and what excellent sense emerges! 'Subtle' (or, as we
should now write, <em>subtile</em>), used also by Chapman (Odyss.
x. 296) of Circe's web, is <em>subtilis</em>, 'fine-spun'; and the
'broken woof' is the web torn by Minerva; 'admits' is
allows of, <em>i.e.</em> contains; for 'orifice' the originals have <em>orifex</em>.
As Shakespeare was a great reader of Golding's Ovid,
Ariachne could never have been <em>his</em> word. A perfect parallel
to the embarrassed structure of this passage is offered by</p>

<p>There is much here that seems dubious. <em>Holds</em> might

'Halts not particularly,' I think, may mean stops at, dwells
on, no individual. For 'wax' we might read, as has been
proposed, <em>verse</em>; but the allusion may be to the waxed tables
on which the ancients wrote. We might also read <em>Which</em>

<p>Something is lost after 'be,' and Timon is never addressed

Lord or some other title of honour. I therefore read 'he will
be <em>blest</em>, <em>Lord</em> Timon.' In ii. 2, we have an omission of
'Lord' by the printer. Singer proposed <em>rewarded</em> after 'be.'
Possibly 'Timon' was a mere addition of the printer's.</p>

<p>If we read <em>Upon</em> or <em>On</em> for 'From,' and point as I have

</div></div>
</div>
<p>I have ventured on these corrections, as this part of the

</div></div>
</div>
<p>The excellent correction of 'rother' for <em>brother</em> of the

</div>
<p>This is a difficult passage. 'Milk-paps' seems to mean
tender young maidens, and editors are probably right in
reading <em>bars</em> for 'barne.' The 'bars,' as Mr. Staunton observes,
seem to mean the cross-lacing on the bosom, still to
be seen in Switzerland. We should perhaps omit ''em,'

<p>I do not think that the text is, in any place in these plays,
more certainly correct than it is here; yet some late editors
adopt without hesitation <em>bisson multitude</em>, the reading of
Collier's folio. By 'bosom multiplied' the poet means the
union or complex of the bosoms, <em>i.e.</em> hearts, affections, of
the people. In his next speech Cor. uses in a similar manner
"multitudinous tongue;" and in ii. 2 we meet "multiplying
spawn." In Lear (v. 3) we have "the <em>common
bosom</em>;" and in our poet's Lover's Complaint "That he did
in the <em>general bosom</em> reign."</p>

<p>By these slight corrections this place gains sense&mdash;a thing
it never had before. All through the speech, it may be observed,
Volumnia acts the part she would have her son perform.
The transposition he had made in the first line&mdash;where
the folio has 'Which often thus'&mdash;having perplexed
the printer, he took 'humble' for a verb, and so introduced
'or' to try to make sense. (Introd. p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>.) Mr. Dyce says

</div></div>
</div>
<p>I agree with Steevens in regarding this passage and the
comments on it as being equally unintelligible. The meaning
seems to be one which Shakespeare frequently expresses
(see Tr. and Cr. i. 3, ii. 3, iii. 3)&mdash;self-praise is no praise.
'Unto itself commendable' is, then, standing high in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>possessor's estimation. The sense yielded by 'tomb' and
'chair' is most trivial, and I would therefore venture to propose</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Hath not a tongue so evident as a charmer's."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Charms and spells, we know, were murmured or muttered in
a low tone ("wizards that peep and that mutter" Is. viii. 19);
and if the final letters of <em>charmer's</em> had been effaced&mdash;like <em>in
him</em> a few lines higher&mdash;and only <em>char</em> left, the printer might
easily have taken it for 'chair,' and so have made 'tomb'
to correspond. For 'chair' Singer reads <em>hair</em>; Collier's
folio <em>cheer</em>. <em>Charmer</em> occurs in Oth. iii. 4, and the poet had
met with it in his Bible. I have introduced it again in Ant.
and Cl. iv. 8.</p>

<p>For 'fouler' Dyce reads <em>faulter</em>, Singer <em>foil'd are</em>. We
might also conjecture <em>fall, and</em>; the final <em>d</em> in this last not
being sounded. <em>Fall</em> and <em>fail</em> come thus together in "Fall
Greeks, fail fame; honour or go or stay" (Tr. and Cr. v. 1).
It seems, however, safest to read, with Malone, as I have
done, <em>founder</em>. We have "All his tricks <em>founder</em>" (H. VIII.
iii. 2). What is said of fire in the first line is a favourite
idea with our poet. We have it again in Two Gent. ii. 4,
K. John, iii. 1. It is an allusion to the hom&oelig;opathic mode
of curing a burn by holding it to the fire. By the fires, etc.,
he means Coriolanus and himself.</p>

of which he had already spoken in Much Ado, ii. 3, and for

<p>The metre would require '<em>O</em> Leonatus!' but as "What

<p class="p2"><em>A</em> (printed 'a or a') is used instead of <em>'e</em> for <em>he</em> when <em>h</em> is
suppressed. Introd. p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>.</p>

<p><em>Able</em> (Lear, iv. 6), enable, back, maintain, support. "Admitted!
aye into her heart. I'll <em>able</em> 'em" (Chapman,
Widow's Tears, ii); "You might sit and sigh first till your
heart-strings broke. I'll <em>able</em> it" (ib. iv.).</p>

<p><em>Absey</em> (K. John i. 1), the <em>a b c</em> or alphabet. The <em>a</em> was
perhaps pronounced as in continental languages.</p>

<p><em>Accommodate</em> (2 H. IV. iii. 2), to be provided, to be off,
like <em>accommoder</em>, Fr. "J'ai découvert qu'elles ne sont pas
<em>fort accommodées</em>" (<em>i.e.</em> not in very good circumstances)
(Molière, Avare, i. 2).</p>

<p><a id="Affection"></a><em>Affection</em> (Mer. of Ven. iv. 1, v. 1, W. Tale, i. 2), conceit,
imagination. "Lo, which a great thing is affectioun! A man
may dye for ymaginacioun" (Chauc. Miller's Tale).</p>

<p><em>Aiery</em>, or <em>eiry</em>, the nest of a bird of prey; and hence (Rich.
III. i. 3), the contents of the nest, the young birds. It is
the French <em>aire</em>, which has the same signification, and which,
being flat and unformed, comes from <em>area</em>. See Notes and
Queries, 3rd S. vi. 43.</p>

<p><em>Aim</em>, in archery. There was a distinction between 'Cry
aim' and 'Give aim.' The former was merely to call on the
archer to shoot; the latter to tell him how his arrow had
gone with respect to the aim or mark.</p>

<p><em>Amaimon and Barbason</em> (M. W. ii. 2, 1 II. IV. ii. 4, II.
V. ii. 1), names of fiends of which little is known. The
dominion of the former was said to be on the north part of the infernal gulf.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
<em>Ancient</em>, ensign, ensign-bearer. It is the French <em>enseigne</em>
with the usual paragogic <em>t</em>.</p>

<p><em>And if</em>, <em>an if</em>, <em>an</em>. These are all used for <em>if</em>. The first is
the original form, framed perhaps after <em>etsi</em>.</p>

<p><em>Anon.</em> Probably a corruption of <em>in one</em>, sc. minute.</p>

<p><em>Aroint.</em> This unusual word is generally regarded as an
interjection equivalent to <em>avaunt!</em> but it may be an indicative,
with an ellipsis of <em>I</em>, and so be a corruption of
<em>averrunco</em>.</p>

<p><em>Arras</em> (so called from the town of that name), tapestry for
covering the walls of rooms. It was fixed on wooden frames
a little distance from the wall; hence people could go behind
it. (Much Ado, i. 3, M. Wives, iii. 3, 1 H. IV. ii. 4,
<em>et alib.</em>)</p>

<p><em>Arthur's Show</em> (2 H. IV. iii. 2), an exhibition of archery
by a toxophile society, whose members, fifty-eight in number,
appeared in the characters of the Knights of the Round
Table. In it Sir Dagonet was the King's Fool.</p>

<p><em>Away</em> i.e. <em>on way</em>. "She never could away with me"
(2 Hen. IV. iii. 2) is, she could not go on the way (<em>i.e.</em>
agree) with me.</p>

<p>"The masculine gender is more worthy than the feminine;
therefore, Licio, <em>backarè</em>." (Lyly, Mydas, i. 2).</p>

<p>In all these places it is evidently assumed that the derivation
is from <em>back</em>; but it may be that <em>Bigarrée</em>, Brindle,
was the name Mortimer had given his sow.</p>

<p><em>Baffle</em> (<em>baffoler</em>, <em>bafouer</em>, Fr.), a part of the ceremony
of degrading a knight. It is described by Spenser, F. Q.
vi. 7.27.</p>

<p><em>Banquet</em> or <em>Banket</em>. This in general answered to the
present <em>dessert</em>, and it was usually served in another room,
or in an arbour (2 H. IV. v. 3). It consisted of fruits,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
sweetmeats, etc. It also answered to our supper after a ball
(H. VIII. i. 4, R. and J. i. 5), and was used sometimes for
a feast in general. By a "running banquet" (H. VIII. i. 4,
v. 3) seems to have been meant a hasty meal, a snatch, as
it were, of food.</p>

<p><em>Basilisco</em> (K. John, i. 1), a character in the old play of
Soliman and Persida.</p>

<p><em>Baked meat</em> (Rom. and Jul. iv. 4), meat-pie. In Webster's
White Devil we have</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>In Cotgrave's Dict. it is rendered by <em>pâtisserie</em>, Fr.</p>

<p><em>Bate</em> (T. Sh. iv. 1, R. and J. iii. 2), in falconry, flapping
the wings, apparently from <em>battre</em>, Fr. It is not easy to see the
difference between it and <em>beat</em>, with which it is joined in the
first of these passages. <em>Beat</em>, however, may be only a misprint
for <em>bate</em> repeated.</p>

<p><em>Bat-fowling</em> (Temp. ii. 1), taking birds by night with a
light and a net. It is fully described in Joseph Andrews,
ii. 10.</p>

<p><em>Bear in hand</em>, amuse with false hopes, and so keep
in one's power. The phrase seems taken from the
<em>manége</em>.</p>

<p><em>Benedicite</em>, the first word of the Canticle called The Song
of the Three Children, in the Liturgy. It was generally used
merely as an interjection.</p>

<p><em>Bias</em>, a weight inserted in one side of a bowl, which of
course would sway it on one side, and prevent its going
straight to the <em>mistress</em>, or jack, at bowls.</p>

<p><em>Bill on neck</em> (As Y. L. i. 2), "With his sword by his side,
a forest <em>bill on his neck</em>, and a chopping-knife under his
girdle" (Arcadia, i.).</p>

<p><em>Bird-bolt</em> (M. Ado, i. 1), a short thick arrow with an
obtuse head used for shooting at birds.</p>

<p><em>Bite the thumb</em> (Rom. and Jul. i. 1) seems to have been
making the <em>figo</em> or fig, by putting the thumb between the
first and second fingers, and then biting it. It was an
expression of contempt or defiance.</p>

<p><em>Black Monday</em> (M. of Ven. ii. 5), said to be Easter Monday,
from the severity of that day, April 4, 1360, by which
Edw. III. lost numbers of his men in France.</p>

<p><em>Block</em>, the mould on which the crown of a hat was
formed, hence the hat itself (Lear, iv. 6, M. Ado, i. 1).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
<em>Bob</em>, a sudden tap on the face; hence a stroke of satire
(As. Y. L. ii. 7). As a verb, to cheat, do out of (Othel.
v. 1).</p>

<p><em>Bolting-hutch</em> (in a mill), the machine by which the flour
is bolted or separated from the bran.</p>

<p><em>Bombast</em>, wadding, padding, from <em>bombax</em> cotton, the usual
material.</p>

<p><em>Books.</em> To be in one's books (M. Ado, i. 1), to be in
favour with. It seems to be taken from the giving credit
of tradesmen.</p>

<p><em>Boots.</em> Give the boots (Two Gent. i. 1) seems to be equivalent
to the present <em>give the sack</em>, <em>i.e.</em> turn away.</p>

<p><a id="Brach"></a><em>Brach.</em> "A mannerly name for all hound-bitches" (Gentleman's
Recreation, p. 27). "A <em>brache</em> or <em>biche</em>, canicula,
petite chienne," Baret, Dict. This seems to be its meaning
everywhere in Shakespeare, except perhaps Lear, iii. 6, and
everywhere else that it occurs. Jonson and Massinger use
it, as <em>bitch</em> is still used by the vulgar, of a low common
woman. Its substitution for that term may have been
caused by the similarity of sound. <em>Braque</em>, Fr. (<em>bracco</em> It.),
is a setting-dog; and in the work just quoted we are told
the Scotch called a dog that ran by scent <em>rache</em>, "the female
thereof in England is called a <em>brache</em>." The Icelandic name
of this dog at the present day is <em>rakkr</em>. "Here is a leysche
of <em>ratches</em> for to run a hare" (Skelton, Interl. of Mag.). Golding
(Ov. Met. p. 33) uses <em>brach</em> and <em>bitch</em> as synonymous and
of hounds. A <em>lady-brach</em> (Lear, i. 4, 1 Hen. IV. iii. 1?)
seems to have been what we now call a parlour-dog;
females being preferred, probably on account of their greater
gentleness. The above derivation of <em>brach</em> is, however, not
quite satisfactory.</p>

<p><em>Break across</em> (As Y. L. iii. 4), used of a spear, in tilting,
when in the charge its handle was broken by the awkwardness
of the tilter. The mode of doing it, however, is not
easy to conceive. Perhaps <em>break</em> was not used in its usual
sense.</p>

<p><em>Break up</em>, carve. It is used (L. L. L. iv. 1) of a love-letter,
called in French <em>poulet</em>.</p>

<p><em>Breast</em> (Tw. N. ii. 3), voice&mdash;containing for contained.</p>

<p><em>Bribed buck</em> (M. W. v. 5), "a buck <em>cut up</em> to be given
away in portions. In O. Fr. <em>bribes</em> were portions of meat
which were given away." So Singer explains it; but I rather
suspect it may be a <em>stolen</em> buck. See Richardson, <em>v.</em> Bribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
<em>Breathe in watering</em> (1 H. IV. ii. 4), to take breath while
drinking. It seems to be taken from horses.</p>

<p class="right">Old Play of Timon, ii. 5.</p>

<p><em>Brief</em>, letter, short writing of any kind, even a verbal
promise, contract, or agreement (All's Well, ii. 3). It may
be an adj., with an ellipsis of the subst.</p>

<p><em>Brown paper</em> (M. for M. iv. 3). This was one of the useless
commodities which usurers compelled unlucky borrowers
to take in lieu of ready money. Rosini, in his Monaca di
Monza, notices it in Italy in the 16th century; Molière, in
L'Avare, in France; and it has continued in England down
to present times.</p>

<p><em>Bucklers.</em> "Give the bucklers" (M. Ado, v. 2) seems to
be a term taken from prize-fighting, signifying to yield, give
up. It is supposed that the bucklers were the prize; but that
is not likely. There may be a use of the plur. for the sing.,
and the phrase may merely mean lay the buckler down or
aside in token of defeat.</p>

<p><em>Budge</em> (<em>bouger</em>, Fr). In Cor. i. 6 and elsewhere it means
to give back, retire.</p>

<p><em>Bulk</em>, breast, chest, not body, as is usually given. In
Spanish <em>bulto</em>, a kindred term, is used in the same sense.</p>

<p><a id="But"></a><em>But</em> (A.S. <em>buton</em>, i.e. <em>be out</em>), without, unless, save, except.
It also (it is not easy to say how) took the place of A.S. <em>ac</em>,
yet, however; and it became a mere inceptive particle like
<em>now</em> and <em>why</em>. When, as it often does, it signifies <em>that ...
not</em>, as in "Not a man <em>but</em> was slain," there seems to be
merely an ellipsis of the personal pronoun. So when it signifies
<em>only</em> there is an ellipsis of the negative; for "We have
<em>but</em> five loaves" (Matt. xiv. 17) is in A.S. "We <em>n</em>abbð
her <em>buton</em> fif hlafas;" and at the present day a peasant would
say "We have<em>n't</em> <em>but</em> five loaves." I therefore, in 1 H. IV.
v. 3, read in my Edition for "There is not" "There is
not <em>but</em>." To my great surprise I have not been able to meet
an exact parallel in any play or other work. We say "There
is <em>not</em> a man <em>but</em> one," etc., and "I can<em>not</em> <em>but</em> say," etc.; but
these are not precisely parallel.</p>

<p><em>Buttons.</em> "It is in his buttons" (M. W. ii. 2), seems to
mean it is in his doublet which is buttoned on him; <em>i.e.</em>
it is in him, he is able to accomplish it.</p>

<a id="By"></a><em>By.</em> This prep. sometimes occurs (like <em>bei</em>, Germ.) in the

<p class="p2"><em>Cade of herrings</em> (2 H. VI. iv. 3), a barrel of <em>red</em> herrings
containing 600, <em>i.e.</em> five hundreds of six score to the hundred.
See Notes and Queries, 3 S. ix. 324.</p>

<p><em>Calipolis</em> (2 Hen. IV. ii. 4), one of the characters in Peele's
Battle of Alcazar.</p>

<p><em>Callat</em>, a term of reproach for a woman. Perhaps it is
merely a corruption of the Irish <em>cailleach</em>, old woman, learned
from the Irish costermongers in London.</p>

<p><a id="Callino_castore_me"></a><em>Callinó castorè me</em> (Hen. V. iv. 4) misprinted <em>calmie custore

<p>of which the last line seems to be unmeaning, and the
second to be the Irish <em>A colleen óg, astore mo chree</em> (A ca&#305;lín
ó&#658; an&#636;tó&#1408; mo c&#1408;oiðe) 'Young girl, the treasure of my heart.'
The last two words, it will be seen, are conjectural; and
were it good Irish we might read, An mín 'the gentle
one.'</p>

<p><em>Camelot</em> (Lear, ii. 2), a town in Somerset, where King
Arthur was said to have kept his court. Its site was on a
hill, near South Cadbury.</p>

<p><em>Candles' ends</em>, <em>buts</em> of candles. It was rather a disgusting
feat of gallants to swallow them for flap-dragons in honour
of their mistresses. 2 Hen. IV. ii. 4.</p>

<p><em>Canvas</em> (2 H. IV. ii. 4, 1 H. VI. i. 3), to shake and toss
in a sieve, of which the bottom was then as now made of
canvas. The use of it in those places is figurative.</p>

<p><em>Card</em> (1 H. IV. iii. 2), to debase by mixture, as when fine
and coarse wool were <em>carded</em> together, and so mingled in the
cloth thence woven. "You <em>card</em> your beer&mdash;if you see your
guests begin to get drunk&mdash;half small, half strong," etc.
(Green's Quip, etc.).</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
<em>Card of ten</em>, the ten of the suits in a pack of cards. To "face
with a card of ten" (T. Sh. ii. 1) seems to mean simply to
turn up, play, a ten, the highest except the coat-cards and
aces.</p>

<p><em>Careires.</em> "Pass the careires" (M. W. i. 1), a term of the
<em>manége</em>, signifying to go at full speed.</p>

<p><a id="Carouse"></a><em>Carouse</em>, a drinking-bout, a large draught. It is usually
derived from Germ. <em>gar aus</em>, 'all out,' which seems to be
confirmed by "boire <em>caraus</em> et <em>alluz</em>" (Rabelais, iii. Prol.).
In German <em>Rausch</em> is intoxication; and this <em>may</em> be the origin
of <em>carouse</em>.</p>

<p><em>Carpet-knight</em> (Tw. N. iii. 4), civilian knight, as opposed
to the military knight; so named probably from the <em>carpet</em>
which covered the table&mdash;not the floor&mdash;in the room in which
the ceremony of conferring knighthood took place.</p>

<p><em>Carraways</em> (2 Hen. IV. v. 3) in the form of comfits, with
apples, were used at the dessert.</p>

<p><em>Carry coals</em>, a term of reproach, because fetching charcoal,
firewood, etc., was the office of the lowest servants in a
household.</p>

<p><em>Carve.</em> This verb, beside its ordinary sense, seems to have
that of talking agreeably, jesting, etc. (L. L. L. v. 2, Mer.
W. i. 3). In Herbert's Prophecy of Cadwallader, 1604, we

<p>It is of constant occurrence in Piers Ploughman.</p>

<p><em>Castle</em> (Tr. and Cr. v. 2), a kind of strong helmet, "and
break the strongest <em>castle</em> that thou hast upon thy head"
(Hist. of Prince Arthur, ch. clviii.).</p>

<p><em>Cataian</em> (M. W. ii. 1), a Chinese. It seems, however, to
be used here without any particular meaning.</p>

<p><em>Ceremony.</em> Besides its ordinary sense of state, pomp,
parade, this word is used for a sacred pledge (Mer. of Ven.
v. 1), ornament of state (Jul. Cæs. i. 1), prodigy (ib. ii. 2).</p>

<p><em>Chamber</em> (2 H. IV. ii. 4), a kind of cannon. It was properly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
a small mortar, hence its name; for it stood almost
erect.</p>

<p><em>Charact</em> (M. for M. v. 1), an abbreviation of <em>character</em>.
We meet it in Piers Ploughman, <em>v. 7600 et alibi</em>.</p>

<p><em>Chase.</em> See <em>Tennis</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cherry-pit</em> (Tw. N. iii. 4), a game played by children. It
consisted in throwing cherry-stones into a small hole.</p>

<p><em>Christendom</em> (K. John, iv. 1), baptism, (All's Well, i. 1)
name given in baptism. It answers to <em>halidom</em>, and to the
Spanish <em>santiguada</em>.</p>

<p><em>Christom-child</em> (H. V. ii. 3). The proper word is <em>chrisom</em>;
for it was, says Blount, "the white cloth which is set by
the minister of baptism upon the head of a child newly
anointed with <em>chrism</em> after his baptism." When the use of
the chrism was abolished, it came to signify "the white cloth
put about or upon a child newly christened, wherewith the
women used to shroud the child if dying within the month,"
and such was called a <em>chrisom-child</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cinque pace.</em> See <a href="#Galliard"><em>Galliard</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Circumvention</em> (Cor. i. 2). The only meaning this word
can have in this place is, apparently, secret information obtained
by stratagem, the enemy being, as it were, circumvented.
A curious instance of the liberties the poet took
with language!</p>

<p><em>Cling</em> (Macb. v. 5), from <em>clingan</em> A.S., to shrink, pine,
wither. "Or <em>clyngest</em> for-drye" (Vis. of P. P. 9011). In
this place of Macbeth it is used in a causative sense, as in
"<em>Clings</em> not his guts with niggish fare, to heap his chest
withal" (Surrey, Eccles. ch. v.).</p>

<p><em>Clock.</em> "A German clock" (L. L. L. iv. 1). Clocks, it
appears, were then, as now, imported from Germany, and
were of a very inferior order.</p>

<p><em>Cloud in his face</em> (Ant. and Cl. iii. 2). This, we are told,
was said of a horse when he had a dark spot between his
eyes.</p>

<p><em>Clown.</em> This term for a licensed jester, and as such nearly
synonymous with <em>Fool</em>, is peculiar to Shakespeare. The
Fool in Lear hardly differs from the Clowns of the other
plays. It probably comes from <em>colonus</em>.</p>

<p><em>Clubs</em> (H. VIII. v. 3, As Y. L. v. 2), the cry to the London
apprentices to come forth with the clubs or bludgeons
which they always kept by them to keep, or as often to
break the peace.</p>

<p><em>Coast</em> (H. VIII. iii. 2), to proceed cautiously, keeping, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
it were, along the shore, a figure taken from navigation.
The Italian <em>piaggiare</em> is used in the same manner. So <em>hedge</em>
in this same passage is figurative&mdash;keeping, as it were, inside
of the hedge.</p>

<p><em>Cock-a-hoop.</em> "You will set cock-a-hoop!" (R. and J.
i. 5). By this some understand taking the cock out of the
barrel, and letting the liquor run to waste. Nares quotes</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i10">"The cock on hoop is set</div>
<div class="i0">Hoping to drink their lordships out of debt."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>But perhaps the original expression may have been <em>Cock on
heap</em>, i.e. on his dunghill, boastful and triumphant.</p>

<p><em>Cock-shut</em> (R. III. v. 3), a large net stretched across a
glade in a wood, in order to catch woodcocks when flying
in the twilight, thence called "cock-shut time."</p>

<p><em>Codpiece</em>, a cod (<em>i.e.</em> pouch or pocket) set in the front of the
hose. It seems to have answered to the present breeches-pockets.</p>

<p><em>Colours.</em> "Fear no colours" (Tw. N. i. 5) would seem to
have been a military expression, denoting no fear of any
banners, <em>i.e.</em> troops or enemies.</p>

<p><em>Concolinel</em> (L. L. L. iii. 1), the commencement of a song,
usually supposed to be Italian. But there is nothing like it
in that language. It was mooted in Notes and Queries if it
were not rather Irish, like so many other airs at that time;
and among the conjectures given, the best was by "Eirionnach"
that it may have been <em>Can colleen yal</em> (Cán cailín &#658;eal).
'Sing, fair girl.' But no such song is known.</p>

<p><em>Copetain</em>, T. of Sh. v. 1 (from <em>cop</em>, i.e. top), high-crowned,
coned, or sugar-loaf. It seems to be a corruption of <em>coppletankt</em>,
<em>coppintank</em>, or <em>coptankt</em>, all signifying the same&mdash;"Galerus
acuminatus," Junius: "Upon their heads they wore
felt hats <em>copple-tanked</em>, a quarter of an ell high or more"
(Comines, by Danet).</p>

<p><em>Cophetua</em> (L. L. L. iv. 1, 2 Hen. IV. v. 3), the name of
an African King, in the ballad, who married a beggar-girl.</p>

<p><em>Coranto</em> (H. V. iii. 5), a lively, gliding kind of dance, in
which the dancer had, as Davies says, "with best order all
order to shun," and "wantonly range everywhere."</p>

<p><a id="Corporal_of_his_field"></a><em>Corporal of his field</em> (L. L. L. iv. 1). Singer remarks, from
Lord Strafford's Letters (ii. 199), that this was a kind of
aide-de-camp employed "in taking and carrying to and fro
the directions of the general or other higher officers of the
field." The ordinary corporal was, as now, the lowest officer.
See Nares, <em>v.</em> Gentlemen of the Round.</p>

<p><em>Cotsall</em> (M. W. i. 1), Cotswold-downs in Gloucestershire,
where there used to be various sports at Whitsuntide. They
were instituted by Mr. Robert Dover, an attorney in the
reign of James I., and continued till after the Revolution.
"The sports were football, skittles, quoits, shovel-board,
cudgel, and single-stick; bull-baiting, cock-fighting, bowling,
wrestling, leaping, dancing, pitching the bar, horse-racing,
ringing of bells, jumping in sacks," etc. See Notes
and Queries, 3 S. ix. 80, 100, 353.</p>

<p><em>Court-cupboard</em> (R. and J. i. 5), a moveable state cupboard,
on the receding shelves of which the family-plate was arranged

<p><em>Court-holy-water</em> (Lear, iii. 2), <em>eau bénite de la cour</em>,
flattery, or rather words without deeds, as plentiful and as
lavishly used in courts as holy water in churches.</p>

<p><em>Cousin.</em> This word was used, in its primitive sense of
<em>consanguineus</em>, of any one that was akin.</p>

<p><em>Creep.</em> Creeping to the Cross was an act of devotion in

Singer tells us, from Lyte's Herbal (1578), was called in
French <em>coquu primevère, brayes de coquu, and Herbe à
coquu</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cue.</em> "Q., a note of entrance for actors; because it is the
first letter of <em>quando</em>, when, showing when to enter and speak"
(Buller, the English Grammar, 1634). This, however, seems
a very forced and pedantic derivation, and the ordinary one,
from <em>queue</em>, Fr., seems preferable. Florio, however, says, "a
prompter, one who keeps the books for the players and teacheth
them, or scholars their <em>kue</em>."</p>

<p><em>Cupid's flower</em> (M. N. D. iv. 1). See <a href="#Love_in_Idleness"><em>Love in Idleness</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Curate</em> (<em>curé</em>, Fr.), the incumbent of a parish; not what
<span class="err" title="original: i">is</span>
now so termed.</p>

<p><em>Curiosity</em> (Lear, i. 2), scrupulousness, affected delicacy,
or niceness. <em>Curious</em> (T. of Sh. iv. 4) has the same
sense.</p>

<p><em>Curst</em> (T. of Sh. i. 1), shrewish, snappish, ill-tempered.
It is usually supposed to be <em>cursed</em>; and it may be so, taking
this part actively. But I rather think it is a metathesis of
<em>cross</em> with a paragogic <em>t</em>, or of <em>crossed</em>.</p>

<p><em>Curtal-axe</em> (As Y. L. i. 3), a corruption of <em>cutlass</em> (<em>coutelas</em>
Fr., <em>coltellaccio</em> It.), a short strong sword: "His <em>curtlax</em> by his
thigh, short, hooked, fine" (Fairf. G. of B. ix. 82), whence
it might be inferred that it was curved.</p>

<p><em>Cut.</em> "Draw cuts" (Com. of Err. v. 1), to draw lots of
paper or straws cut in different lengths. He who drew the
longest was the winner.</p>

<p><em>Cut bowstrings</em> (M. N. D. i. 2). When a match was made
to shoot at butts, each said that if he did not <em>hold</em> his promise
they might <em>cut his bowstring</em> and exclude him from their
society.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Damn.</em> This word had not its present restricted sense;
like <em>damno</em>, it meant simply to condemn, or even merely disapprove
of. So <em>damned</em> and <em>damnable</em> often signified merely
reprehensible.</p>

<p><em>Dancing-horse</em> (L. L. L. i. 2), a celebrated horse belonging
to one Bankes, who had taught him to dance, to count, and
perform various other feats. He travelled over the Continent
exhibiting him; and it is said, but probably with little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
truth, that both master and horse were burnt at Rome for
witchcraft.</p>

<p><em>Dare</em> (H. VIII. iii. 2) had the sense of terrify&mdash;whence
derived it is hard to say&mdash;when used of taking larks in a
net, by means of a hawk, or mirrors on a piece of scarlet
cloth.</p>

<p><em>Day-bed</em> (Tw. N. ii. 5, R. III. iii. 7), a couch or sofa; for
it was not confined to bed-chambers.</p>

<p><em>Day-woman</em> (L. L. L. i. 2) is generally said to be a dairy-maid;
for a <em>day-house</em>, in the old dictionaries, is where cheeses
are made. As, however, <em>day-woman</em> occurs only in this
place, and <em>day's-man</em> has quite a different sense, it may be
only a printer's error for 'dai<em>ry</em>-woman.'</p>

<p><em>Defy</em> (K. John, iii. 4, 1 H. IV. i. 3), renounce, reject, cast
off&mdash;as <em>défier</em>, Fr., is distrust, put no trust in.</p>

<p><em>Devil rides on a fiddle-stick</em> (1 H. IV. ii. 4), a proverbial
expression denoting something strange, unexpected. Its
origin is not known.</p>

<p><em>Dian's-bud</em> (M. N. D. iii. 1), the flower of the Agnus
castus. "The virtue of this herb is that it will keep man
and woman <em>chaste</em>" (Maur, by Lynacre).</p>

<p><em>Diffused</em> (M. W. iv. 4), obscure, strange, as it were <em>confused</em>
and jumbled. "Speak Welsh to him. I doubt not
but thy speech will be more <em>diffuse</em> to him than his French
shall be to thee" (Cav. Life of Wolsey).</p>

<p><em>Dole</em>, share, part (<em>Theil</em>, Germ). "Happy man be his dole"
(W. T. i. 2, 1 H. IV. ii. 2) is, Be it his part to be called Happy
man.</p>

<p><em>Dough.</em> "My cake is dough" (T. Sh. v. 1) means things
are not going well with me. It is a figure taken from bread
baked on a girdle, still in use in America.</p>

<p><em>Drum.</em> "John Drum's Entertainment" (All's Well, v. 1).
There was a dramatic piece so named (1601), in which Jack
Drum, a servant, was continually foiled in his intrigues.</p>

<p><em>Ducdamè</em> (As Y. L. ii. 6) would appear to be meant for
Italian (<em>duc da me</em>, 'bring to me?').</p>

<p><em>Dudgeon</em> (Macb. ii. 1), the handle of a dagger, properly a
handle made of the wood of the box-root, of which this is
the name, as given by Bp. Wilkins, Gerard, and others.</p>

<p><em>Dun.</em> "To draw Dun out of the mire" (R. and J. i. 4).
Gifford, who says he had often played at this game, thus
describes it:&mdash;"A log of wood is brought into the midst of
the room; this is <em>Dun</em> (the cart-horse), and a cry is raised
that he is stuck in the mire. Two of the company advance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>either with or without ropes, to draw him out. After repeated
efforts they find themselves unable to do it, and call
for more assistance. The game continues till all the company
take part in it, when <em>Dun</em> is extricated of course; and
the merriment arises from the awkward and affected efforts
of the rustics to lift the log, and sundry arch contrivances to
let the ends of it fall on one another's toes."</p>

<p><em>Dun's the mouse</em> (R. and J. i. 4), an apparent allusion to
the colour of the mouse, which, however, is not dun. The
phrase was probably made for the sake of a play on <em>done</em>. It
is similar to "The cat is gray" (Lear, iii. 6).</p>

<p><em>Durance.</em> "Robe of durance" (1 H. IV. i. 2). "The jerkin-man
is come, but your <em>robe of durance</em> is yet not finished"
(Letter of Thomas Winter, of the Gunpowder Plot, in Notes
and Queries, 3 S. i. 342). "Let me live, but I will give thee
a good <em>suit of durance</em>" (Westward Ho!). "I refuse to wear
<em>buff</em> for the lasting, and shall be content to apparel my brain
in <em>durance</em>" (Cornwalleys, Essays). It thus appears that
<em>durance</em> was a strong kind of cloth.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Each.</em> "At each" (Lear, iv. 6), <em>i.e.</em> the end of one
being joined to that of the other. The text seems to be
right.</p>

<p><em>Eggs for money</em> (W. T. i. 2) seems to mean cheating, bullying,
giving little or no value for money.</p>

<p><em>Element</em>, <em>par excellence</em> the air, as that by which we breathe
and exist (Tw. N. i. 1, J. C. i. 3, Temp. v. <em>ad fin.</em>). It was believed
that man was composed of the four elements (Tw. N.
ii. 3, Ant. and Cl. v. 2).</p>

<p><em>'Em.</em> This is not <em>them</em> by aphæresis; it is the old <em>hem</em> of
Chaucer, etc. In Marston's plays it is printed <em>'hem</em>.</p>

<p><em>End.</em> This word was used in a variety of ways in conjunction
with others. Thus we have "there an end" (Two
Gent. ii. 1, T. Sh. v. 2); "still an end" (ib. iv. 4); "for an
end," in fine (Cor. ii. 1); also "word and end" (Chauc.
Monk's Tale, Tr. and Cr. iii.); "tale and end" (Gower, C.
Am. v). "Most an end," perpetually (Mass. Very Woman,
iii. 1), used also by Milton, and even by Warburton. See
Gifford on Mass, <em>ut sup.</em> In most of these cases <em>an</em> is
<em>and</em>.</p>

<p><a id="Enew"></a><em>Enew</em> (M. for M. iii. 1). "How presently upon the landing
of the fowl she [the falcon] came down like a stone and
<em>enew'd</em> it, and suddenly got up again, and suddenly upon a
second landing came down again, and, missing of it in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>downcome, recovered it beyond expectation, to the admiration
of the beholder, at a long flight" (Nash, Quaternio, etc.,
1633). <em>Enew</em> is therefore to teaze, worry, terrify, and probably
comes from <em>ennuyer</em>, Fr.</p>

<p><em>Entrance.</em> In 1 H. IV. i. 1, this word is most abusively employed
for <em>mouth</em>. A most remarkable instance of the liberties
the poet took with the Queen's English.</p>

<p><em>Ephesian</em> (M. W. iv. 5, 2 H. IV. ii. 2) apparently means
jovial companion, toper; but why, it is hard to say.</p>

<p><em>Extent</em> (As Y. L. iii. 1) "An <em>extent</em> or <em>extendi facias</em> is so
called because the sheriff is to cause the land, etc., to be
appraised to their full <em>extended</em> value before he delivers them
to the plaintiff" (Blackstone).</p>

<p><em>Eye</em> (Temp. ii. 1), what we now call a shade of colour.
"Red with an <em>eye</em> of blue makes a purple" (Boyle). As it
elsewhere (R. and J. v. 1) signifies glance, look, that may
be a general sense of it.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Fading</em> (W. T. iv. 3), the name of an Irish dance, perhaps
the <em>Rinka fadha</em>
(&#1408;in&#658;ce <small>F</small>aða), long dance. It was also used
as the burden of a song.</p>

<p><em>Fan</em> (M. W. ii. 2, R. and J. ii. 4). The fan of those times
was quite different from the present one. It was composed
of feathers set in a round handle of ivory, and even of silver
or gold, so as to be sometimes of the value of £40.</p>

<p><em>Fancy</em>, love, as being frequently the creation of imagination.
The term <em>fancy-man</em> seems to be a relic of this sense.
It was also (2 H. IV. iii. 2) the name of an air or tune, as
Such a one's Fancy, <em>i.e.</em> favourite.</p>

<p><em>Fashions</em> (T. Sh. iii. 2), from <em>farcins</em>, Fr., the farcy in
horses.</p>

<p><em>Fast and loose</em> (Ant. and Cl. iv. 11. L. L. L. iii. 1, K. John,
iii. 1), the trick still played at fairs, and called <em>Prick in the
garter, the belt, the loop</em>. It was well known to the ancients,
by whom it was named <span lang="el" title="himanteligmos">&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#8056;&#962;</span>, under which name
it is accurately described by Julius Pollux (ix. 7); and that
it was known in the Middle Ages is proved by this line in
the Roman de la Rose&mdash;which, by the way, none of the
critics have understood&mdash;"C'est li gieu de <em>boute-en-corroie</em>,"
6882.</p>

<p><a id="Feature"></a><em>Feature</em>, form, person, make, <em>faiture</em>, O. Fr. It was very
rarely, if at all, restricted to the countenance as now, or used
in the plural. In As Y. L. iii. 3 there is perhaps a printer's error.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
<em>Fern-seed</em> (1 H. IV. ii. 1). As the seed of the fern is nearly
invisible, it was believed to render so those who carried it. As
Brown (Brit. Past. ii. 2) terms it <em>one-night-seeding</em>, it would
appear that there was a mystery and a difficulty about obtaining
it.</p>

<p><em>Fig</em> (2 H. IV. v. 3, H. V. iii. 6). It was a mode of insulting
to put the thumb between two of the fingers, and hold it
out to a person. It was chiefly practised in Spain and Italy.</p>

<p><em>Fights</em> (M. W. ii. 2), "the waist-cloths which hang round
about the ship to hinder men from being seen in fight"
(Phillips, World of Words).</p>

<p><em>First.</em> "Two of the first, like coats in heraldry" (M. N.
D. iii. 2). The shield was divided in nine different forms;
of which the <em>first</em> was an equal division from top to bottom,
as when the arms of a man and his wife were united. In
this case there was only one crest, that of the husband.</p>

<p><em>First-born of Egypt</em> (As Y. L. ii. 5). This is supposed to
mean high-born persons. But as it only occurs in this place,
it may be nothing more than a humorous expression without
any definite meaning.</p>

<p><em>Fives</em> (T. Sh. iii. 2), <em>avives</em> Fr., the strangles in horses;
"an inflammation of the kernels, between the chap and the
neck of the horse" (Markham, Way to get W. i. 39).</p>

<p><em>Flap-dragon</em> (L. L. L. v. 1), "a small combustible body
set on fire, and put afloat in a glass of liquor" (Nares).
"Raisins in hot brandy were the commonest flap-dragons"
(Id.). As raisins are not combustible, I rather think it was
the liquor that was set on fire, and the feat was getting the
flap-dragon out of the flame that enveloped it.</p>

<p><em>Flaw</em> (2 H. IV. iv. 4, 2 H. VI. iii. 1), a sudden blast of
wind. Warburton, who appears to be right, says it was the
idea of some philosophers that it was vapour condensed by
the cold of night, which, being liberated by the heat of the
sun in the morning, caused the <em>flaw</em> or sudden burst of
wind.</p>

<p><em>Flibbertigibbet</em> (Lear, iii. 4). This, and all the succeeding
names of fiends in this play, was taken by the poet from
Harsnet's Declaration, etc., 1603.</p>

<p><em>Flights</em> (M. Ado, i. 1), long light-feathered arrows for
shooting at a mark.</p>

<p><em>Flirt-gill</em> (R. and J. ii. 4), also <em>gill-flirt</em>. It is a compound
of Gillian, a very common woman's name at the time, and
<em>flirt</em>, which was perhaps a corruption of <em>fleer it</em> or <em>fleer at</em>.</p>

<p><em>Florentius</em> (T. Sh. i. 2), the hero of a tale in Gower's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
Confessio Amantis, similar to The Wife of Bath's Tale in
Chaucer.</p>

<p><em>Fool's Paradise</em> (R. and J. ii. 4), a state of deceptive happiness.
The exact origin of the phrase is not known.</p>

<p><em>Foot-cloth</em> (2 H. VI. iv. 7), a cloth or housing covering a
saddle-horse, and reaching nearly to the ground at each
side. Its object was to protect the feet and legs from dirt
and mire.</p>

<p><em>For</em> (Oth. i. 3, Cymb. iv. 2), with an ellipsis of <em>that</em>, because.
It was also used with an ellipsis of <em>fear of</em>.</p>

<p><em>Forfeits in a barber's shop</em> (M. for M. ii. 2). As barbers'
shops were places of common resort, to keep order in them
rules were made and hung up declaring the forfeit or penalty
for each transgression, which, however, could only be enforced
by public opinion.</p>

<p><em>Formal</em> (C. of Err. v. 1, Tw. N. ii. 5, R. III. iii. 1), in form,
regular, ordinary, (T. of Sh. iv. 2, A. Y. L. ii. 7) precise.</p>

<p><em>Fox</em> (H. V. iv. 4), a name for a sword; possibly so called
from the maker's name, like Andrew Ferrara.</p>

<p><em>French crown</em> (M. for M. i. 2), the crown of a Frenchman's
head; a French coin; a bald head caused by the French
disease. Hence, as in this place, it is frequently played
on.</p>

<p class="p2"><a id="Galliard"></a><em>Galliard</em> (Tw. N. i. 3, H. V. i. 2), a lively springing kind of
dance. Davies styles it "swift and wandering," with
"passages uncertain to and fro," and "with lofty turns and
caprioles in the air." As it had "five paces," it is said to
have been the same with the Cinque Pace; but that hardly
accords with the mentions we have of the latter, also corruptly
called Sink apace (M. Ado, ii. 1, Tw. N. i. 3).</p>

<p><em>Gallimaufry</em> (W. T. iv. 3, M. W. ii. 1), <em>galimafrée</em>, Fr., a
kind of hash or ragout. In these places it is used abusively
as applied to persons, meaning mixture or jumble. Its origin
is not known.</p>

<p><em>Gallowglas.</em> See <a href="#Kerne"><em>Kerne</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Gaskins</em> (Tw. N. i. 5), same as <em>gallygaskins</em>, loose breeches
or trousers. The derivation is uncertain.</p>

<p><em>Generous</em> (M. for M. iv. 6, Oth. iii. 3), noble-minded,
<em>generosus</em>.</p>

<p><em>Gentle</em>, noble, of good birth (<em>gentilis</em>); thence, brave, gallant,
worthy; and finally, courteous, kind, mild, sweet-tempered,&mdash;such
qualities being most usually found among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
the well-born. This last sense is the least usual in the dramatists.</p>

<p><em>Gentry</em> (Ham. ii. 2), courtesy, good manners.</p>

<p><em>Gig</em> (L. L. L. iv. 3), a whipping-top.</p>

<p><em>Giglot</em> (M. for M. v. 1, 1 H. VI. v. 1, Cymb. iii. 1), a
female wanton. It is perhaps connected with <em>giggle</em>.</p>

<p><em>Gillian</em>, the English form of Juliana, a name so common
in former times that <em>Jack and Jill</em> was a usual phrase to denote
two persons of the opposite sexes. St. Juliana was a
Florentine, who was not canonized till 1729, so that the
name could hardly have come from her. In Ireland Julia
(in Irish Sheelah&mdash;<em>Sila</em>) is a common name among the peasantry.
There was a Saint Julia, virgin martyr, who was
put to death in the fifth century.</p>

<p><em>Gillyvor</em> (W. T. iv. 3), of which <em>gillyflower</em> is a corruption,
is the flower named <em>caryophyllum</em>, whence is formed the
French <em>giroflée</em>.</p>

<p><em>Gongorian</em> (M. W. i. 3), supposed to be a corruption of
<em>Hungarian</em>; but that is uncertain.</p>

<p><em>Good-night</em> (2 H. IV. iii. 2), like <em>Fancy</em>, a kind of song
or ballad. Thus there was Johnny Armstrong's Good
Night.</p>

<p><em>Good year</em> (Much Ado, i. 3, 2 H. IV. ii. 4), a more delicate
form of <em>gougère</em>, the French disease.</p>

<p><em>Gourd and fullam</em> (M. W. i. 3), names of uncertain origin
for false dice; called in the same place <em>high and low</em>, sc. men.
They were of course hollowed and leaded internally so as to
turn up the numbers required.</p>

<p><em>Greek.</em> "Merry Greek" (Tr. and Cr. i. 2, iv. 4). In the
Latin Classics the Greeks were always represented as lively
and cheerful (see <em>Merry</em>), as compared with the more sombre
Romans; and hence the phrase "Merry as a Greek" may
have come into use in England. Still the original may
have been "as merry as a grig," the grig or young eel being
so lively and vivacious.</p>

<p><em>Green-sleeves</em> (M. W. ii. 1, v. 5), a celebrated air. The
song of "Since laws were made for every degree" in the
Beggar's Opera is to this air.</p>

<p><em>Groundling</em> (Ham. iii. 2), one who stood on the ground
in the pit of the theatre, where there were no seats, and the
price of admittance was only a penny.</p>

<p><em>Guard</em> (M. Ado, iii. 4, L. L. L. iv. 3), an edging or
binding on clothes, so named, probably, as securing them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
from tearing. It then came to signify any trimming etc.
on dress.</p>

<p><em>Guinever</em> (L. L. L. iv. 1), the queen of King Arthur in the
romances.</p>

<p><em>Gull</em> (1 H. IV. v. 1, Tim. ii. 1), an unfledged bird; still
used of goslings. It then came to signify a dupe, one
imposed on (Tw. N. iii. 2, v. 1), also a trick, imposition
(M. Ado, ii. 3).</p>

<p><em>Gumm'd velvet</em> (1 H. IV. ii. 2), velvet stiffened with gum,
whence it was apt to <em>fret</em> or fray.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Halcyon</em> (Lear, ii. 2). "A little bird, called the king's-fisher,
being hanged up in the air by the neck, his neb or
bill will be always direct or straight against the wind."&mdash;<em>Book
of Notable Things.</em></p>

<p><em>Half-face</em> (K. John, i. 1, 2 H. iv. iii. 1), in profile, as showing
but half the face.</p>

<p><em>Halidom</em> (Two Gent. iv. 2), and corruptly <em>holy dame</em> (H.
VIII. v. 1, R. and J. i. 3), same as <em>christendom</em>, christening,
consecrating by the rite of baptism.</p>

<p><em>Hall.</em> "A hall, a hall!" (R. and J. i. 5), a cry to clear the
room, and make a space for the dancers. <em>Ring</em> is still used
in a somewhat similar sense.</p>

<p><em>Hangers</em> (Ham. v. 2), the short straps by which a sword
was hung from the belt.</p>

<p><em>Hatch</em> (Tr. and Cr. i. 3), adorn, ornament. It is properly
to engrave or work with lines&mdash;<em>hacher</em>, Fr.</p>

<p><em>Have</em>, take. This sense is frequent in the Pilgrim's Progress,
and we still speak of <em>having</em> a person before a magistrate.
The expressions <em>have at you</em> and <em>have with you</em> are
elliptical; and <em>have</em> is there, I take me.</p>

<p><em>Hazard.</em> See <a href="#Tennis"><em>Tennis</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Head</em> (1 H. IV. iv. 3, v. 1, 2 H. IV. i. 3, ii. 2), army,
forces. "To make head," to raise an army.</p>

<p><em>Hell</em> (C. of Er. iv. 2), the worst part of a prison. Marot
has a poem on a prison, called <em>L'enfer</em>.</p>

<p><em>Hermit.</em> In "We rest your hermits" (Macb. i. 6) the
proper word would be <em>beadsmen</em>; but as the speaker is a
woman, the poet ventured to use 'hermit' in a sense it never
has had before or since. See <em>Entrance</em>.</p>

<p><em>Hide fox, and all after</em> (Ham. iv. 2, M. Ado, ii. 3), a play
of children. It was probably what is now called Hide-and-Seek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
<em>Hip.</em> "Have on the hip" (M. of V. i. 3, Oth. ii. 1) seems
to be taken from wrestling, and to signify getting the opponent
across one's hip, and thus being able to give him a
severe fall.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">"<em>To get</em> the Pagan <em>on the hip</em>;</div>
<div class="i2">And having caught him right, he doth him lift</div>

<div class="i2">That down he threw him."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Harr. Or. Fur. xlvi. 117.</p>

<p><em>Hiren.</em> "Have we not Hiren here?" (2 H. IV. ii. 4). It is a
corruption of the Greek proper name of Irene, made by Peele
in his play of The Turkish Mahomet and the fair Greek
Hiren.</p>

<p><em>Hob.</em> This, like <em>Bob</em>, <em>Dob</em>, was merely a short form of
Robert. It and <em>Dob</em> are still preserved in proper names, as
in Hobbs, <em>Hobson</em>. Hob-goblin answers to the German
<em>Knecht-Ruprecht</em>.</p>

<p><em>Hob-nob</em> (Tw. N. iii. 4), is <em>hab-nab</em>, i.e. 'have or no have,'
hit or miss.</p>

<p><em>Hobby-horse</em> (L. L. L. iii. 1, Ham. iii. 2). This was an essential
character in the morris-dance. It was the figure of a horse
fastened round the waist of a man, whose legs were concealed
by the horse's long footcloth, outside of which hung a pair
of artificial legs and thighs. The man, of course, gave motion
to the horse, prancing about, neighing, etc. It may still be
seen at the booths in fairs and at minor theatres. The
Puritans were bitter enemies to the Hobby-horse, which was
therefore frequently left out, whence the cry of</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"For oh! for oh! the Hobby-horse is forgot."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><em>Hoodman-blind</em> (Ham. iii. 4). The game now called Blindman's-buff.</p>

<p><em>Holla</em> (As Y. L. iii. 2). See <a href="#Soft_soft_you"><em>Soft</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Hope.</em> This word is frequently used in the sense of mere
expectation of either good or evil, a sense it still retains in
America. The corresponding verbs in Greek, Latin, and
some modern languages have the same sense.</p>

<p><em>Hot-house</em> (M. for M. ii. 1), a bagnio, so named from the
hot baths which it contained.</p>

<p><em>Humour.</em> This word, signifying moisture (<em>humor</em>), came
by the physiology of the time to mean character, idiosyncrasy.
See Jonson's Every Man out of his Humour, The
Stage. In the character of Nym, Shakespeare shows us how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
it was abused. It frequently occurs in the sense of state of
mind, inclination, but never in its present sense; we still say
<em>good</em> and <em>ill humour</em>. The adj. <em>humorous</em> occurs once (R.
and J. ii. 1) in the primitive sense moist; but its usual meaning
is, capricious. See <em>Wit</em>.</p>

<p><em>Humour of Forty Fancies</em> (T. of Sh. iii. 2), supposed to
be a collection of poems or tales. There is no copy of it
remaining.</p>

<p>'<em>Hundred Merry Tales</em>' (M. Ado, ii. 1), name of a common
jest-book at that time.</p>

<p><em>Hunts-up</em> (R. and J. iii. 5), the name of an air used to
rouse up sportsmen in the morning. It began with "The
hunt is up, the hunt is up." Puttenham says it was composed
by one Gray in the time of Henry VIII., with whom
it was a favourite.</p>

<p><em>Hurricano</em> (Lear, iii. 2, Tr. and Cr. v. 2), what is now
called a water-spout.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>I.</em> So they wrote what we now write <em>Aye</em>. As it was the
same as the first personal pronoun, there was often a play on
it, as in Two Gent. i. 1, R. and J. iii. 2.</p>

<p><em>Iceland-dog</em> (H. V. ii. 1), a shaggy kind of dog imported
from Iceland, a great favourite in England at that time.</p>

<p><em>Idle</em> (M. for M. iii. 2, Oth. i. 3), empty, void, of no force,
<em>idel</em>, A.S., <em>eitel</em>, Germ.: "And the earth was <em>idel</em> and void"
(Wicklif).</p>

<p><em>Imp</em>, graft, hence child, young devil, by ellipsis of the
devil. As a verb it was a term of falconry, meaning to splice
a broken feather of the wing (R. II. ii. 1), which was effected
by running a needle up the broken feather, the other end of
which was run up the feather that was to be added.</p>

<p><em>Incense</em>, properly Insense (M. Ado, v. 1, R. III. iii. 2, H.
VIII. v. 1), inform, put sense, as it were, into.</p>

<p><em>Incony</em> (L. L. L. iii. 1, iv. 1). This is usually understood to
mean fine, delicate, pretty; but the following passage of the old
play The Shoemaker's Holiday gives the true sense and origin
of it: "There they shall be knit, like a pair of stockings,
in matrimony; there they'll be <em>in conie</em>." <em>Cony</em>, like <em>lamb</em>,
<em>mouse</em>, etc., was in fact one of the endearing terms then in
use between married couples; so that <em>to be in cony</em> was to
be in a state of matrimonial endearment. Thence <em>in cony</em> or
<em>incony</em> gradually came into use as an adj. of endearment in
general&mdash;just as <em>in life</em> became <em>alive</em> and <em>live</em> (as an adjective).</p>

<p><em>Index</em> (R. III. ii. 2, Tr. and Cr. i. 3), what we now call
the table of contents in a book. It also (R. III. iv. 4, Ham.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
iii. 4, Oth. ii. 1) seems to mean the dumb show before the
acts of a play.</p>

<p><em>Inherit</em> (Two Gent. iii. 2, R. II. i. 1), possess, cause to
possess.</p>

<p><em>Iniquity</em> (R. II. iii. 1, 1 H. IV. ii. 4), a name of the Vice,
or buffoon, of the old moralities. He had asses' ears, a long
coat, and a dagger of lath, with which, leaping on the Devil's
back, he used to belabour him; but he was always carried
off by him in the end.</p>

<p><em>Inkle</em> (L. L. L. iii. 1, W. T. iv. 3), a kind of tape. It
came perhaps by aphæresis from A.S. <em>rápincle</em>, cord.</p>

<p><em>Instance</em> (R. III. iii. 2, Ham. iii. 2), motive, cause, (Tr. and
Cr. v. 2) proof.</p>

<p><em>Intrenchant</em> (Macb. v. 7) seems to mean which cannot be
cut so as to remain divided. It is only found in this place.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Jack.</em> From the universality of this familiar form of <em>John</em>,
it became the usual appellation of servants and others of the
lower orders, something like the <em>Jacques</em> of the French.
<em>Jack</em> and <em>Jill</em> (L. L. L. v. 2, M. N. D. iii. 2, T. Sh. iv. 1),
therefore, represented the two sexes in humble life.</p>

<p><em>Jack-a-Lent</em> (M. W. iii. 3, v. 5), a stuffed figure set up to
be thrown at in Lent, as cocks were on Shrove Tuesday.</p>

<p><em>Jack-o'-the-clock</em> (R. II. v. 5, R. III. iv. 2), figures of men
that used to strike the hours on clocks.</p>

<p><em>Jade</em> (possibly akin to Germ. <em>Gaul</em>), a name for a horse, indicating
sometimes a vicious ("<em>Jade</em>, a naughty horse," Baret),
sometimes a contemptible one, at other times expressing
pity. It sometimes, however, was equivalent to horse, steed,
as in</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">"When Hyperion's son</div>
<div class="i0">Shall couch in west his foam-bedabbled <em>jades</em>."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Fuimus Troes.</p>

<p><em>Jesses</em> (Oth. iii. 3), short straps of leather or silk fastened
to the legs of a hawk, with rings on them, through which
passed a leash or strap, which the falconer twisted round his
hand. When the hawk was let go, the leash was drawn out
of the rings.</p>

<p><em>Jewel.</em> "Wear this <em>jewel</em> for me; 'tis my picture" (Tw. N.
iii. 4). We may hence see that jewel was any ornament in
gold, enamel, etc.</p>

<p><em>Jig</em> (Ham. ii. 2), a lively poem or ballad, as well as a dance,
its only meaning at present.</p>

<p><em>John-a'-dreams</em> (Ham. ii. 2). This means evidently a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
stupid dreamy person; but the origin of the phrase is unknown.</p>

<p><em>Judas' hair</em> (As Y. L. iii. 4). It was the popular belief
that Judas Iscariot's hair was red. It owed its origin probably
to the dislike of red hair, which still prevails.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Kam</em> (Cor. iii. 1), crooked, awry. This is one of the very
few English words borrowed from the Welsh or Irish language.</p>

<p><em>Keech</em> (1 H. IV. ii. 4, 2 H. IV. ii. 1, H. VIII. i. 1), the
inside fat of an ox rolled up in a lump.</p>

<p><em>Keel the pot</em> (L. L. L. v. 2), cool the pot, probably by adding
cold water to keep it from boiling over.</p>

<p><em>Keep</em> (M. for M. iii. 1, 1 H. IV. i. 3), dwell, reside.
Hence the provincial and American <em>keeping</em>-(<em>i.e.</em> sitting-)
<em>room</em>.</p>

<p><a id="Kerne"></a><em>Kerne</em> (R. II. ii. 1, 2 H. VI. iii. 1, Macb. i. 2), sometimes
joined with <em>Gallowglas</em>&mdash;the former denoting the light-, the
latter the heavy-armed soldier of the native Irish. Barnabie
Riche terms the kernes "the very dross and scum of
the country, a generation of villains not worthy to live." "The
<em>Gallowglas</em>," says Stanyhurst, "useth a kind of pollax for
his weapon. These men are grim of countenance, tall of
stature, big of limb, lusty of body, and strongly timbered.
The <em>kerne</em> is an ordinary foot-soldier, using for weapon his
sword and target, and sometimes his piece, being commonly
good marksmen."</p>

<p><em>Kiln-hole</em> (M. W. iv. 2, W. T. iv. 4). This is apparently
the lower part of the malt-kiln, where the fire was. It
would seem from these places that it was usual in those times
to have private malt-kilns.</p>

<p><em>Knave</em>, boy, lad, fellow, <em>cnâfa</em> A.S., <em>Knabe</em> Germ.</p>

<p><em>Knife</em> (2 H. IV. ii. 4, R. and J. iii. 1, Macb. i. 5). It
appears to have been the custom in those times for women
to carry a straight-handled knife in a sheath at their girdle,
like a dagger. As we meet the term <em>wedding-knives</em>, it would
seem to have formed part of the bridal array.</p>

<p><em>Knot</em>, body, gang, party; a wavy bed in a garden.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Lantern</em> (R. and J. v. 3), a louvre, or turret full of windows
for admitting or transmitting light.</p>

<p><em>Lavolta</em> (H. V. iii. 5, Tr. and Cr. iv. 4), a quick bounding
dance for two persons. It would seem not to have been unlike
the waltz of the present day.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
<a id="Leave"></a><em>Leave</em> (Two Gent. iv. 3, M. of Ven. v. 1), to part with, give
away.</p>

<p><em>Leg.</em> "Make a leg" (R. II. iii. 3, T. Sh. iv. 1), to make
a bow or obeisance&mdash;from putting forward one leg and withdrawing
the other.</p>

<p><em>Leiger</em> (M. for M. iii. 1, Cymb. i. 6), a resident ambassador,
apparently from <em>liggan</em>, <em>ligg</em>, to lie, <em>i.e.</em> reside.</p>

<p><em>Leisure.</em> Shakespeare, and apparently he alone, uses this
word (R. III. v. 2) for brief time, and also (R. II. i. 1) for
occupation, engagement.</p>

<p><em>L'envoy</em> (L. L. L. iii. 1), lines terminating a French ballad
and conveying the moral, or an address to the person for
whom the poem was intended.</p>

<p><em>Lightning before death</em> (R. and J. v. 3), the temporary reviving
of the mental powers sometimes seen in sick persons
a little before death. It may be so named from an analogy
with lightning; but it more probably means relieving, easing.</p>

<p><em>Light-o'-love</em> (Two Gent. i. 2, M. Ado, iv. 3), the name of
an old tune for dancing; no words to it are known.</p>

<p><em>Line.</em> "Under the line" (Temp. iv. 1), <em>i.e.</em> at stake, a
phrase of the tennis-court: "Let us keep the laws of the
court&mdash;that is, stake money under the line (<em>sotto la corda</em>).
Is it not so?&mdash;Yea, sir, you hit it right" (Florio, Second
Fruits, ch. ii). Elsewhere in this play (iv. 1) <em>line</em> is lime- or
linden-tree.</p>

<p><em>Line of life</em> (M. of V. ii. 2)&mdash;in fortune-telling, one of the
lines of the hand.</p>

<p><em>Lipsbury pinfold</em> (Lear ii. 2). Pinfold is a pound for
cattle; but no place of the name of Lipsbury is known. As
Nares observes, this is probably a coined name, like <em>Lob's
pound</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lock</em> (M. Ado, iii. 3, v. 1), <em>i.e.</em> love-lock, a lock of hair
plaited and tied with ribbon, hanging on the left side down
to the shoulder, or even lower. It was greatly the fashion
among the men of the poet's time, and much later. Prynne
wrote furiously against it.</p>

<p><em>Loggat</em> (Ham. v. 1), a small log of wood. Steevens, of
his own knowledge, describes the game of <em>loggats</em> as played
at sheep-shearing feasts. A stake was stuck in the ground,
at which they threw loggats, and he that threw nearest to it
was the winner; the prize was a black fleece. This he gave
to the farmer's maid to make her a petticoat, on the condition
of her kneeling down on it to be kissed by the company.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
<em>Lord.</em> "Good lord" (All's Well, ii. 3; "dear lady,"
Temp. i. 2) is patron or protector of any one.</p>

<p><em>Lord have mercy upon us!</em> (L. L. L. v. 2), the inscription
put on houses where the plague was, to warn people against
entering them.</p>

<p><em>Lord's sake.</em> "For the Lord's sake!" (M. for M. iv. 3).
This was the word of prisoners for debt from the prison
window, calling on the passers-by to give them some relief.</p>

<p><a id="Lose"></a><em>Lose</em> (H. V. iv. 1), waste, employ without gaining by it.
So also <em>loss</em> (M. for M. ii. 4) is mere employment, or occupation&mdash;waste,
as it were.</p>

<p><em>Lots to blanks</em> (Cor. v. 2). Here <em>lot</em> is used in the sense
of prize in a lottery.</p>

<p><a id="Love_in_Idleness"></a><em>Love in Idleness</em> (M. N. D. ii. 1), the pansy, <em>Viola tricolor</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lover.</em> This word was sometimes used where we should
now say friend, as in Jul. Cæs. ii. 3, iii. 2, v. 1, Cor. v. 2.</p>

<p><em>Luxury</em> (Ham. i. 5, Lear, iv. 6, Tr. and Cr. v. 2), lechery,
lewdness, fornication, the <em>luxuria</em> of the schoolmen, <em>lussuria</em>
It.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Magnifico</em> (M. of V. iii. 2, Oth. i. 2), a title given to the
nobles of Venice.</p>

<p><em>Magot-pie</em> (Macb. iii. 4), magpie. It is the French <em>Margot-pie</em>,
just like our Madge-howlet, Jack-daw, Tom-tit, etc.</p>

<p><em>Mall.</em> By "Mistress Mall" (Tw. N. i. 3) is probably meant
merely a lady, without any particular allusion.</p>

<p><em>Man</em> (T. Sh. iv. 1)&mdash;in falconry, tame a haggard or wild
hawk, by making her submissive to the <em>man</em> or keeper.</p>

<p><em>Mammet</em> (1 H. IV. ii. 3, R. and J. iii. 5), doll, puppet.
It is probably the same as <em>maumet</em>, idol, image (from <em>Mahomet</em>?).</p>

<p><em>Mandragora</em> (Oth. iii. 3, A. and C. i. v), the mandrake, a
strong narcotic or soporific.</p>

<p><em>Mandrake</em> (R and J. iv. 3, 2 H. IV. i. 2, iii. 2, 2 H. VI.
iii. 2). From its root being forked, and bearing some resemblance
to the legs and thighs of a man, some superstition
was attached to it, such as its groaning when pulled out of
the ground, and causing madness or death to the person who
pulled it.</p>

<p><em>Mankind</em> (W. T. ii. 3, Cor. iv. 2), masculine (of a woman).</p>

<p><em>Manner.</em> "Taken with the manner" (L. L. L. i. 1, 1 H.
IV. ii. 4), to be caught in the fact, with the stolen goods
upon him. It was a law-phrase, the proper term being
<em>mainour</em>, from <em>manier</em>, Fr., derived from <em>main</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
<em>Manningtree-ox</em> (1 H. IV. ii. 4). This town in Essex
used to hold fairs, by the tenure of exhibiting stage-plays;
and there were great festivities there at Whitsun-ales and
other festal times, at which probably&mdash;for we have no account
of it&mdash;oxen used to be roasted whole, etc.</p>

<p><em>Mantuan</em> (L. L. L. iv. 2), a Carmelite friar of the 15th
century, who wrote several works, among which were Latin
Eclogues, in imitation of those of Virgil. This last was a
school-book in our poet's time; and the words quoted are the
beginning of the first Eclogue.</p>

<p><em>Marchpane</em> (R. and J. i. v), a confection of almonds, sugar,
and flour pounded, blended, and baked, so as to form a kind
of biscuit. The name occurs in most European languages,
but its origin is uncertain.</p>

<p><em>Mare.</em> "Riding the wild mare" (2 H. IV. ii. 4) is playing
at the game of see-saw or weighdy-buckety&mdash;<em>bascule</em>, Fr.</p>

<p><em>Marian.</em> "Maid Marian" (1 H. IV. iii. 3) was in the
ballads the bride of Robin Hood. She was a character in
the morris-dances, and was frequently represented by a man,
but more usually by a woman of ill life.</p>

<p><em>Martlemas</em>, i.e. <em>Martinmas</em> (2 H. IV. ii. 2), Nov. 11, St.
Martin's day, the beginning of winter, the decline of the
year.</p>

<p><em>Maze.</em> "The quaint mazes in the wanton green" (M. N. D.
ii. 2) may perhaps have been merely the fairy rings; but
there was in many places what was called a Maze or Troy
town, or Walls of Troy, in which young people used to run
for amusement. "They are generally," says Stukely, "upon
open green places by the sides of roads or rivers, upon meadows
or the like, near a town." For descriptions of them
see Notes and Queries, 3 S. x. 283, 398.</p>

<p><em>Meacock</em> (T. Sh. ii. 1), a tame, dastardly person. Its most
probable derivation is <em>meekock</em>, perhaps its original form (<em>-ock</em>
being a diminutive, as in <em>hillock</em>, <em>bullock</em>, etc.).</p>

<p><em>Measure</em> (L. L. L. v. 2, As Y. L. v. 4), a stately, slow
dance, like the minuet of the last century.</p>

<p><em>Meazle</em> (Cor. iii. 2), leper (<em>mesel</em>, <em>meseau</em> Old Fr.; from
<em>misellus</em>?).</p>

<p><em>Medicine</em> (All's Well, ii. 1, W. T. iv. 3), physician (probably
<em>médecin</em>, Fr.).</p>

<p><em>Mephistophilus</em> (M. W. i. 1), the well-known spirit or
familiar in the story of Dr. Faustus. In Marlowe's play on
the subject he was probably represented as very slender in
person.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
<em>Merchant</em> (R. and J. ii. 4) was used as we now use <em>chap</em>
(<em>i.e.</em> chapman), in <em>my chap</em>, a <em>saucy chap</em>, etc.</p>

<p><em>Merry</em>, cheerful, pleasant; the adj. of <em>mirth</em>. Hence
<em>merry</em> (<em>i.e.</em> pleasant) England.</p>

<p>where the "mery tale" is a sermon.</p>

<p><em>Mess</em> (L. L. L. iv. 3, 3 H. VI. i. 4), a set of four persons
at a meal, the party being arranged in fours. It is probably
the Spanish <em>mesa</em>, table.</p>

<p><em>Milliner</em> (1 H. IV. i. 3), a man who carried on the business
now appropriated to women; probably from <em>Milan</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mobled</em> (Ham. ii. 2), having the face covered. "The
moon doth <em>mobble</em> up herself" (Shirley, Gent. of Venice).
Its derivation is uncertain; but it may be connected with
<em>muffle</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mock-water</em> (M. W. ii. 3) may allude to the usage of
judging of diseases by the urine; but it is uncertain.</p>

<p><em>Modern</em> (As Y. L. ii. 7, iv. 1, All's Well, v. 3, Macb. iv.
3), common, trivial, such as we may meet with every day.
<em>Modern</em> comes from <em>hodiernus</em>.</p>

<p><em>Monarcho</em> (L. L. L. iv. 1). "Monarcho the Italian"
(Nash, Have with You, etc.). "Monarcho that lived about
court" (Meres, Pal. Tamia).</p>

<p><em>Month's mind</em> (Two Gent. i. 2). This was originally a
service in the church for the soul of a person deceased, performed
a month after his death, in mind, <em>i.e.</em> remembrance,
of him. After the Reformation, when such a usage ceased,
the phrase still remained; and as <em>mind</em> signified inclination
as well as memorial, it came to signify a great longing which
had, as it were, lasted a month. This seems to be the simple
explication.</p>

<p><em>Mops and mowes</em> (Temp. iii. 3, Cymb. i. 7), ridiculous
distortions of the face and body. <em>Mop</em> may be only a corruption
of <em>mock</em>, and <em>mow</em> of <em>mouth</em>&mdash;we still say <em>make
mouths</em>&mdash;or the French <em>moue</em>, which has the same sense.</p>

<p><em>Moral</em> (T. Sh. iv. 4, M. Ado, iii. 4), meaning, as in the
<em>moral</em> of a fable. In Tr. and Cr. iv. 4, it seems to be the
same as <em>motto</em>.</p>

<p><em>Morris</em> (A. Well, ii. 2), <em>i.e.</em> morris-dance, as it were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
Moorish dance, an amusement on May-day, which was long
kept up, but confined to the chimney-sweeps, in London.
Its chief characters were Maid Marion, Friar Tuck, the
Clown, the Hobby-horse, etc.</p>

<p><em>Mort of the deer</em> (W. T. i. 2), notes blown on the horn on
the death of the deer.</p>

<p><em>Motion</em> (Two Gent. ii. 1, W. T. iv. 2), puppet, puppet-show,
as being <em>moved</em> and put in action by strings.</p>

<p><em>Motley</em> (As Y. L. ii. 7), the dress of Fools, as formed of
divers colours.</p>

<p><em>Mousehunt</em> (R. and J. iv. 4), a name of the stoat; but here
it seems to be used ambiguously as a hunter of mice, <em>i.e.</em>
women, for whom <em>mouse</em> was a term of endearment.</p>

<p><em>Murdering-piece</em> (Ham. iv. 5), a piece of ordnance placed
in loop-holes of a castle or fortress, or the port-holes of a
ship's forecastle, from which was discharged case-shot
filled with bullets, nails, pieces of iron, etc. <em>Meurtrière</em>
(Fr.) is, loop-hole.</p>

<p><em>Mutton</em> (Two Gent. i. 1, M. for M. iii. 2). The single term,
and that of <em>laced mutton</em>, mean a woman&mdash;in the opinion of
critics in general, a woman of bad life; and Cole in his Dict.
has "<em>Laced mutton</em>, scortum." Yet this may be questioned.
In Molière's G. Dandin (iii. 14), the maid says to her mistress,
of whose virtue she is the maintainer, <em>pauvre mouton!</em>
so that both in French and English <em>mutton</em>, i.e. sheep, ewe,
may have been, like <em>lamb</em>, a term of endearment. "There's
another goodly <em>mutton</em> going" (Green's Tu Quoque), of a
modest woman.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i10">"A fine <em>lac'd mutton</em></div>

<div class="i0">That reads her the Corranto every week."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Jonson, Mask of Nep. Triumph.</p>

<p>Here, we have no reason to suppose that they were women
of bad character. So also in Two Gent. it is of a lady of
unblemished fame that <em>lac'd mutton</em> is used. Speed calls
himself "a lost mutton," and her "a lac'd mutton," where,
by the way, we must pronounce "lac'd" <em>last</em>, or we miss
the humour. It may be observed, as Nares and others have
not seen it, that the allusion in <em>laced</em> is to the lacing of the
dress in front. Hence the frequent cry, <em>Cut my lace!</em></p>

<p class="p2"><em>Nettle of India</em> (Tw. N. ii. 5), a zoophyte, it is said, called
<em>Urtica marina</em>, abounding in the Indian seas. "The flower
of India, pleasant to be seen, but whoso smelleth to it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
feeleth present smart" (Green, Card of Fancie), whence
Shakespeare probably took it, would rather seem to indicate
a plant.</p>

<p><em>Nice</em> (T. Sh. iii. 1, R. and J. v. 2), silly, trifling, from
<em>niais</em>, Fr.</p>

<p><em>Nicholas</em> (Two Gent. iii. 1, 1 H. IV. ii. 1). This Saint
appears to have had a double office,&mdash;the one as the patron of
schools and learning, as he was celebrated for his piety and
love of learning from his infancy; the other, we know not
how, as the patron of thieves and highwaymen, who were
called <em>St. Nicholas' clerks</em>.</p>

<p><em>Night-gown.</em> This was the name of the night-dress of
both women and men (Macb. ii. 2, Ham. iii. 4). It is still
used, at least in the country, for night-dress. The night-gown
was only used by persons of some rank and consideration;
people in general went to bed naked, <em>buffing the blanket</em>,
as it was termed in Ireland. It may be here observed that
<em>gown</em> was, like <em>gonna</em>, It., whence it is derived, used very
extensively at that time. So we have <em>sea-gown</em> (Ham.
v. 1), for a sailor's outer coat, a pilot-coat, as we should now
say.</p>

<p><em>Nine men's morris</em> (M. N. D. ii. 1). "In that part of Warwickshire
where Shakespeare was educated, and the neighbouring
parts of Northamptonshire, the shepherds and other
boys dig up the turf with their knives to represent a sort of
imperfect chess-board. It consists of a square, sometimes only
a foot in diameter, sometimes three or four yards. Within
this is another square, every side of which is parallel to the
external square; and these squares are joined by lines drawn
from each corner of both squares, and the middle of each line.
One party, or player, has wooden pegs, the other stones,
which they move in such a manner as to take up each other's
<em>men</em>, as they are called; and the area of the inner square is
called <em>the pound</em>, in which the men taken up are impounded.
These figures are by the country-people called <em>Nine Men's
Morris</em> or <em>Merrils</em>, and are so called because each party has
<em>nine</em> men." (James, in Var. Shakespeare.) This, it must be
confessed, is not very intelligible, and it is rather remarkable
that Nares takes no notice of it. On the contrary, he says
that Nine Men's Morris is "evidently only another name"
for Nine-holes. In this he must be wrong, as the word
<em>Morris</em> shows; but Shakespeare may have confounded the
two, and have meant Nine-holes, as would seem to be indicated
by "filled up with mud."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
<em>Nobody</em> (Temp. iii. 2). "The picture of Nobody was a
common sign. There is also a woodcut prefixed to an old
play of Nobody and Somebody, which represents him"
(Singer).</p>

<p><em>Noddy</em> (Two Gent. i. 1), a fool, or rather perhaps a nobody.
"Thersites, the glorious <em>noddy</em>" (Puttenham).</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Ere you came here poor I was somebody,</div>
<div class="i0">The king delighted in me; now I am a <em>noddy</em>."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Dam. and Pith.</p>

<p>It may be connected with <em>noodle</em>. It was also a game at
cards, something like cribbage, in which the knave was called
<em>knave-noddy</em>, to which last, it may be, Speed alludes.</p>

<p><em>Nonce</em> (1 H. IV. i. 2), or Nones, is simply <em>ones</em>, <em>once</em>, with
the paragogic <em>n</em>, and signifying that one time.</p>

<p><em>Novum</em> (L. L. L. v. 2), a game at dice, at which the full
number of players would seem to have been five. As the
principal throws were nine and five, it was named <em>Novemquinque</em>.</p>

<p><a id="Nuncle"></a><em>Nuncle</em>, i.e. <em>uncle</em> with the paragogic <em>n</em>, of which there
were so many instances. In Lear, it is the term used by the
Fool to the King; and in Fletcher's Pilgrim (iv. 1), Alinda
uses it, when assuming the character of a fool; but this may
have been a mere imitation of the Fool in Lear. <em>Uncle</em>
and <em>Aunt</em> (M. N. D. ii. 1, W. T. iv. 2) may have been originally
only names for elderly persons: the former at least
is still used in this manner in Cornwall; and the American
custom of so styling elderly negroes of both sexes may be a
remnant of it.</p>

<p><em>Nut-hook</em> (M. W. i. 1, 2 H. IV. v. 4), a hook for pulling
down the branches of nuts. It was, as in these places, used
figuratively of a bailiff.</p>

<p><em>Nutmeg.</em> "A gilt nutmeg" (L. L. L. v. 2), was a common
gift at Christmas and other festivals.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Object.</em> This word was used, of both persons and things, in
the same manner as we now use <em>subject</em>. Of persons we still
employ it with the ellipsis of <em>of pity</em>, as it seems to be used in
Tim. iv. 3; but Shakespeare uses it also with that of <em>of love</em>.
(Two Gent. ii. 4, Cymb. i. 7.) The French also used it in
this sense (see Molière <em>passim</em>).</p>

<p><em>One.</em> As this appears to be pronounced <em>on</em> (Two Gent, ii.
1), it is assumed that such was its sound, but it was in fact
pronounced as at present; for in the Contention, etc., the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
original of 2 H. VI., we have "all's <em>wonne</em> (one) to me."
In Chaucer's time it was sounded like <em>own</em>, for he always
writes it <em>oon</em>, and it retains this sound in <em>alone</em>, <em>atone</em>, <em>only</em>.</p>

<p><em>Or ere.</em> This should be <em>or e'er</em>; for <em>or</em> is ere, before, and
we have the full phrase <em>or ever</em> in the Bible (Dan. vi. 24,
Ps. lviii. 8) and elsewhere.</p>

<p><em>Osprey</em> (Cor. iv. 7). This bird of prey was supposed to
exercise a kind of fascination over the fish which it captured.</p>

<p><em>Out of God's blessing into the warm sun</em> (Lear, ii. 2)&mdash;a
proverb signifying from good to bad, the origin of which has
not yet been shown.</p>

<p><em>Overscutched huswives</em> (2 H. IV. iii. 2) seems to mean the
harlots who had been well whipped in the house of correction.
<em>Scutch</em> (same as <em>scotch</em>), to beat, to scourge, is still
used of flax, and in Ireland of a mode of beating out wheat;
<em>huswife</em> or housewife, signified <em>hussy</em>, a corruption of it.</p>

<p><em>Owch</em> (2 H. IV. ii. 4). This word, whose origin is extremely
obscure, seems to signify ornament, jewel, etc.</p>

<p><em>Owl.</em> "The owl was a baker's daughter" (Ham. iv. 5).
Douce says this is a common tradition in Gloucestershire.
"Our Saviour went into a baker's shop, where they were
baking, and asked for some bread to eat. The mistress of
the shop immediately put a piece of dough in the oven to
bake for him; but was reprimanded by her daughter, who,
insisting that the piece of dough was too large, reduced it to
a very small size. The dough, however, immediately began
to swell, and presently became of a most enormous size;
whereupon the baker's daughter cried out, <em>Heugh, heugh,
heugh!</em> which owl-like noise probably induced our Saviour
to transform her into that bird for her wickedness."</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Painted cloth</em> (As Y. L. iii. 2), <em>i.e.</em> cloth or canvas painted
in oil, used like tapestry for hanging the walls of sitting-rooms
and bed-chambers. It was both cheaper and more
lasting than tapestry, and, like it, had stories and mottoes
on it.</p>

<p><em>Palabras</em> (M. Ado, iii. 4) and <em>Paucas [pocas] palabras</em> (T.
Sh. Ind.) Sp., words, few words.</p>

<p><em>Parish top</em> (Tw. N. i. 3). It was the custom to keep a large
whipping-top in each parish in the country parts for the
peasantry to use in frosty weather to keep them warm with
exercise.</p>

<p><em>Partlet</em> (W. T. ii. 3, 1 H. IV. iii. 3), the name of the hen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
in Chaucer's Tale of the Nonnes Prest&mdash;used in these places
of a woman who, like her, gave advice, etc., to her husband.</p>

<p><em>Passy-measure</em> (Tw. N. v. 1), the Italian <em>passo mezzo</em>. It
was a slow grave dance, correlative to the Galliard, but with
only half the number of steps. It may have been the same
as the Pavin (from <em>pavo</em>?), which is joined with it.</p>

<p><em>Patch</em> (C. of Err. iii. 1, M. of V. iii. 5, Macb. v. 3), fool.
"Patch was the name of a Fool kept by Cardinal Wolsey,
and who deservedly had the honour of transmitting his appellation
to a very numerous body of descendants, he being,
as Wilson observes in his Art of Rhetorique, 1553, 'a notable
fool in his time'" (Gifford on Mass. New Way, etc. iii. 2).
He may, however, have been so named from his dress.</p>

<p><em>Path</em> (J. C. ii. 1), to pace, walk, go along.</p>

<p><em>Pax</em> (H. V. iii. 6), a piece of wood or metal, with the

<p><em>Pensioners</em> (M. W. ii. 2, M. N. D. ii. 1). The band of
Gentlemen Pensioners was instituted by Queen Elizabeth.
It was composed of tall handsome young men, of rank and
fortune, who were splendidly attired.</p>

<p><em>Pict-hatch</em> (M. W. ii. 2) is said to have been a noted tavern
or brothel in Turnbull-street, Clerkenwell. The picked
hatch or half-door with spikes (whence the name) was a
common defence of brothels.</p>

<p><em>Piece</em>, one, individual. It was, and is, used in English,
French, and other languages, both of persons and things.
So we say a piece of cannon, a fowling-piece, pieces of
money, so much a-piece, <em>i.e.</em> to each, etc. A remarkable
instance of this use of <em>piece</em> occurs in the Roman de la Rose
(ver. 16099), where it denotes the individuals of the various
species formed by Nature.</p>

<p>to men.</p>

<p><em>Pin</em> (L. L. L. iv. 1)&mdash;in archery, the black peg with which
the <em>clout</em> or <em>white</em> was fastened in the middle of the butt.</p>

<p><em>Placket</em> (L. L. L. iii. 1, W. T. iv. 3). "<em>Torace</em>, the breast
or bulk of a man; also the middle space between the neck
and the thighs; also a <em>placket</em>, a stomacher" (Florio). This
puts the meaning of this word beyond dispute. In Winter's
Tale it signifies the part covered by it.</p>

<p><em>Point-device</em> (L. L. L. v. 1, As Y. L. iii. 2), precise, exact
in dress and manners. It is said to be the French <em>point
dévisé</em>; but there is no such phrase in French. It may be
<em>point de vice</em>.</p>

<p><em>Pomander</em> (W. T. iv. 3), probably, as Minshew says, from
<em>pomme ambre</em>. It was a ball, etc., often of silver, perforated,
and containing perfumes; so that it would seem to
answer to the present smelling-bottle. Perhaps it was the
same as the pouncet-box (1 H. IV. i. 3).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
<em>Poor-John</em> (R. and J. i. 1), dried hake, a coarse kind of
food.</p>

<p><em>Porpentine</em>, a corruption of <em>porcupine</em>. Always the form
used by Shakespeare; so Portingale for Portugal.</p>

<p><em>Potatoes</em> (M. W. v. 5). It is curious that this tuber,
which had been lately brought to England, should have
been regarded, as it was, as an incentive to venery.</p>

<p><em>Pox</em>, i.e. pocks, were properly the pits or holes <em>poched</em> or
sunk in the face by the disease now called the <em>small-pox</em>,
then simply the <em>pox</em>. Hence there was no indelicacy in its
use by a lady (L. L. L. v. 2).</p>

<p><em>Pride of place</em> (Macb. ii. 4) seems to mean the greatest
height to which a falcon flew, previous to making the stoop.
<em>Place</em> seems equivalent to <em>pitch</em>.</p>

<p><em>Princock</em>, <em>princox</em> (R. and J. i. 5), a pert forward youth.
Perhaps <em>prince-cock</em>, little prince; <em>cock</em> is a diminutive.</p>

<p><em>Priscian</em>, a celebrated Latin grammarian. Blundering in
grammar was termed breaking his head, hence "a little
scratched" (L. L. L. v. 1).</p>

<p><em>Prone</em> (Cymb. v. 4), prompt, ready, unembarrassed.</p>

<p><em>Puppet.</em> "The puppets dallying" (Ham. iii. 2) seems to
mean the apparent motion of the babies in the eyes, <em>i.e.</em> the
reflections of objects on the outer part of the pupil.</p>

<p><em>Putter-out</em> (Temp. iii. 3), one who, on going on his travels,
placed in the hands of some one a sum of money, on condition
of receiving three, four, five, etc. times that sum in case
of his safe return. It was a very common practice in those
days.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Quail</em> (Tr. and Cr. v. 1) is used figuratively of a loose
amorous woman, the quail being regarded as an amorous
bird. <em>Bevy</em> was used alike of quails and of women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
<em>Quality</em>, profession, occupation (Ham. ii. 2), chiefly the
dramatic; the persons of it (Temp. i. 2).</p>

<p><em>Quarry</em> (<em>curée</em>, Fr., <em>curata</em>, It. See Bocc. Thes. vii. 76, Orl.
Inn. ii. 10, 60), properly the entrails of the game, the part
given to the hounds; a heap or pile of slaughtered game
(Ham. v. 2, Macb. iv. 3, Cor. i. 1). It was also used of
the game itself even while afoot.</p>

<p><em>Quern</em> (M. N. D. ii. 1), a hand-mill; but in this place
Shakespeare evidently uses it for <em>churn</em>.</p>

<p><em>Quiddit and quillet</em> (Ham. v. 1). The first of this is a
corruption of the scholastic <em>quidditas</em>, and denotes a subtle
distinction; the second is the same as <em>quibble</em>, whence <em>quip</em>,
and is a corruption of <em>quidlibet</em>.</p>

<p><em>Quietus</em> (Ham. iii. 1), "a word used by the Clerk of the
Pipe and Auditors of the Exchequer, in their acquittances
or discharges given to accountants, usually concluding with
<em>abinde recessit quietus</em>; which is called <em>Quietus est</em>" (Reed,
note in Dodsley's Old Plays).</p>

<p><em>Quinapalus</em> (Tw. N. i. 5). This and Pigrogromitus, etc.,
afterwards (ii. 2) used by the Clown, are probably mere
words invented by the poet, like the foreign language in
All's Well.</p>

<p><em>Quintaine</em> (As Y. L. i. 2). The quintaine here alluded to
seems to be the simpler one in use in the poet's time. It
was formed by a cross bar turning with a pivot on a pole, at
one end of which was a figure, at which the player was to
run with his lance, and at the other a sand-bag, which would
give him a hard blow, if he struck so as not to be out of the
way when it came round by the revolution of the bar. A
quintaine is still to be seen at Offham Green, in Kent.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Rabato</em> (M. Ado, iii. 4), a kind of ruff or collar, <em>rabat</em>, Fr.
from <em>rabattre</em>, to throw back. It is said to have been originally
merely the collar of the shirt turned back, as was the
case with boys' shirts some years ago.</p>

<p><em>Rascal</em> (As Y. L. iii. 3, 1 H. VI. iv. 2) "is properly the
hunter's term given to young deer, lean and out of season"
(Puttenham). This is the sense in which this word is usually
understood; but on the other hand we have, in the Return
from Parnassus, 1666, "I caused the keeper to sever
the <em>rascal-deer</em> from the <em>bucks of the first head</em>. Now, sir, a
buck is in the first year a <em>fawn</em>; the second year a <em>pricket</em>;
the third year a <em>sorrel</em>; the fourth year a <em>soare</em>; the fifth a
<em>buck of the first head</em>; the sixth year a <em>complete buck</em>."</p>

<p>It would therefore appear that the <em>rascal</em> was simply the
deer that had not yet reached his fifth year, and perhaps the
word was <em>raw</em> (immature) <em>skull</em>. It was used metaphorically
in our poet's time as now. Fletcher uses it more than once
of a woman.</p>

undressed.</p>

drest and undrest; and in Macb. ii. 3, "manly <em>readiness</em>"
for men's clothes. To <em>ready</em> the hair is still used in some
places for combing and arranging it.</p>

<p><em>Recheat</em> (M. Ado, i. 1), notes played on the horn to call off
the dogs.</p>

<p><em>Regiment</em> (Ant. and Cleop. iii. 6), government, rule; (R.
III. v. 3) body of troops, separate command.</p>

<p><em>Region</em> (R. and J. ii. 2, Ham. ii. 2), the air. The space
between the lunar sphere and the earth was divided into the
region of air and the region of fire; the air was the region
<em>par excellence</em>, as nearest to the earth. See <em>Element</em>.</p>

<p><em>Rest.</em> The phrase "set up rest" (All's Well, ii. 1, M. of
V. ii. 2, W. T. iv. 3, R. and J. iv. 5) in these plays is figurative,
derived from gaming, chiefly at the game of cards
called Primero. As this game came from Spain it brought,
like Ombre, its terms with it, and <em>rest</em> was the Spanish
<em>resto</em>, which meant not, as is usually supposed, the stake, but
the bet or wager, which appears to have been made by the
players only. "What shall we play for?&mdash;One shilling
<em>stake</em> and three <em>rest</em>" (Florio, Second Fruits). The Spanish
phrase for laying a wager, or making a bet at play, was <em>echar
el resto</em>, put or throw down the sum betted; and this became
in English <em>set up the rest</em>. The reason perhaps was because
this phrase was already in use in a military sense, as the
matchlock guns, on account of their weight and the mode
of firing them, required a rest or support. The phrase was
also used (R. and J. v. 3, Lear, i. 1) for making one's abode.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
<em>Restie</em> (Cymb. iii. 6), "dull, heavy, idle, inert" (Bullokar).</p>

<p><em>Revels</em> (H. VIII. i. 4) seems in this place to be what was
called mixed dancing, in which both sexes partook. "Here
they take forth the ladies and the <em>revels</em> begin" (Jonson,
Masque of Lethe). Its general signification, however, was
sports and amusement of any kind. It comes from <em>réveiller</em>,
Fr.</p>

<p><em>Riming rats to death</em> (As Y. L. iii. 2). There is abundant
evidence of the belief that in Ireland rats could be killed by
metrical charms. This notion would seem to have been
common to the whole Celtic race; for M. Villemarqué
(Barzaz Breiz, i. 1xx.) says that when some bad verses were
made relating to the cholera in Bretagne, an old peasant observed
"au fond, peu importe; l'essentiel était que le choléra
fût <em>chansonné</em>. Il l'est; la chanson fera fuir la peste."</p>

<p><em>Roast.</em> "Rule the roast" (2 H. VI. i. 1) was probably
used originally of cocks, the proper term being <em>roost</em>, as it
perhaps was here, where it is printed <em>rost</em>. It would thus be
similar to Cock of the Walk.</p>

<p><em>Rosemary</em> (W. T. iv. 3, Ham. iv. 5). This plant, for some
unknown reason, was held to be a symbol of remembrance,
and was used at weddings and funerals.</p>

<p><em>Rouse</em> (Ham. i. 4). See <a href="#Carouse"><em>Carouse</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Rue</em> (W. T. iv. 3, R. II. iii. 4, Ham. iv. 5) was called <em>herb
of grace</em>, probably from its resemblance to <em>rue</em>, pity.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Sack</em> (2 H. IV. 1, <em>et alib.</em>). There can be no doubt that
this celebrated wine was nothing else but what is now called
<em>sherry</em>, <em>sherris-sack</em>, as Falstaff terms it. <em>Sack</em> is <em>seco</em>, Sp.,
as it was a <em>dry</em> wine; sherry is from the town of Xeres, the
guttural <em>x</em> being as usual pronounced <em>sh</em>. See Naress' long
article <em>Sack</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sackerson</em> (M. W. i. 1), a celebrated bear at Paris-garden,
named, as was the custom, after the bear-ward.</p>

<p><em>Safe</em> (Temp. iii. 1, M. for M. i. 1, K. John, iv. 2, Macb. i.
4), secure, from which there is no danger, that may be relied
on.</p>

<p><em>Sanctify</em> (Cor. iv. 6), to bless, make the sign of the cross.</p>

<p><em>Seel</em> (Oth. i. 3, Macb. iii. 1), to close the eye-lids of a
hawk by passing a fine thread through them, with a view
to making it tame.</p>

<p><em>Sennet</em>, <em>sinnet</em>, <em>cynet</em>, <em>signate</em>, a set of notes on the trumpet
or clarion, usually employed to denote the approach of a
person of rank. It is perhaps only a corruption of <em>sonata</em>, It.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
<em>Servant.</em> In the gallantry of those days <em>servant</em>, as the
correlative of <em>mistress</em>, denoted the lover. It came from the
French <em>serviteur</em>, which occurs in this sense continually in
the Nouvelles of the Queen of Navarre. In Italian 'cavalier
servente' is hardly yet out of use.</p>

<p><em>Setabos</em> (Temp. i. 2). "The giants [Patagonians], when
they found themselves fettered, roared like bulls, and cried
upon their great devil, Setabos, to help them" (Eden, Hist.
of Travel, 1577).</p>

<p><em>Shard</em> (Ham. v. i), a piece of broken pot, tile, etc. This
word has also two other senses&mdash;namely, a piece of cow-dung,
and a scale, the latter only in these lines of Gower:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"He mighte noughte that serpent dere;</div>
<div class="i0">He was so <em>scherded</em> all aboute."</div>

<div class="i0">Whose <em>sherdes</em> shinen as the sonne."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Ib. vi.</p>

<p>And it is a question in which of these senses Shakespeare
understood <em>shard</em> (Ant. and Cleop. iii. 2, Macb. iii. 2, Cymb.
iii. 3) when speaking of the beetle. In the first "they were
his <em>shards</em> and he their beetle," the cow-dung, though the
beetle's natal place, could hardly be meant, as he had then to
do with only one shard; while supposing the wing-cases to be
meant, the sense is plain: in the second "the <em>shard-borne
beetle</em>" is ambiguous; for <em>born</em> and <em>borne</em> were the same
word: in the third, "the <em>sharded</em> beetle" can only mean
properly the beetle that has shards, and it is opposed to "the
full-wing'd eagle." The fact, then, seems to be that the poet
took this word from Gower, and applied it to the wing-cases
of the beetle, which he supposed to be the wings, a piece of
ignorance in zoology not <span class="err" title="original: be">to be</span> wondered at in one who asserted
(M. of Ven. v. 1) that the nightingale does not sing by day.</p>

<p><em>Sheriff's post</em> (Tw. N. i. 5). It was the custom to have
painted posts at the doors of city magistrates, on which proclamations,
etc. were put up.</p>

<p><em>Shove-groat</em>, a kind of game. "It requires," says Strutt, "a
parallelogram to be made with chalk, or by lines cut upon
the middle of a table, about 12 or 14 inches in breadth, and
3 or 4 feet in length; which is divided latitudinally into
nine equal partitions, in every one of which is placed a
figure in regular succession from one to nine. Each of the
players provides himself with a smooth halfpenny [formerly
a groat or shilling] which he places upon the edge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
table, and striking it with the palm of his hand drives it
towards the marks; and according to the value of the figure
affixed to the partition wherein the halfpenny rests his
game is reckoned; which generally is stated at thirty-one,
and must be made precisely. If it be exceeded, the player
goes again for nine, which must also be brought exactly, or
the turn is forfeited; and if the halfpenny rests upon any of
the marks that separate the partitions, or overpasses the external
bounderies, the go is void."</p>

<p><em>Shrew.</em> This well-known word is used of men also in
Chaucer, signifying, a bad, a wicked person: in its later
restriction to women it is nearly synonymous with <em>scold</em>.
It would seem to come from some lost Anglo-Saxon verb&mdash;of
which we have a trace in <em>beshrew</em>&mdash;akin to the German
<em>schreien</em>, to cry out, scream. <em>Shrewd</em>, now used only in the
sense of mental acuteness, signified (H. VIII. v. 2) ill,
malicious.</p>

<p><em>Side.</em> "Carry out a side" (Lear, v. 1), means win a game
at cards, as "pull down a side" was to lose it. It would
seem that these phrases were only used of games where
there were partners. <em>Sides</em> is still used of athletic games
where there are two parties.</p>

<p><em>Sink-apace.</em> See <a href="#Galliard"><em>Galliard</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Skains-mate</em> (R. and J. ii. 4). Perhaps the best interpretation
of this unusual term is common woman, whore, who,
like Doll Tearsheet (2 H. IV. ii. 4), usually carried a knife.
<em>Skain</em> is the Irish <em>sgian</em>, knife.</p>

<p><em>Sleave, and sleave-silk</em> (Macb. ii. 2, Tr. and Cr. v. 1), the
soft floss silk before it is twisted.</p>

<p><em>Sleeve-hand</em> (W. T. iv. 3), cuff or wristband. In the same
place <em>square</em> is the part covering the bosom:</p>

<p><a id="Soft_soft_you"></a><em>Soft, soft you.</em> These expressions, which so frequently
occur, are verbs; <em>soft</em> coming from <em>soften</em>, as <em>haste</em> from
<em>hasten</em>. The meaning is relax, stop, hold back. It may be
here observed that the hunting-term <em>soho</em> is a combination
of <em>soft</em> and <em>hold</em>, both apocopated, meaning hold back, do not
start the hare; and that <em>tallyho</em> is <em>tarry, hold</em>, let the fox get
off, give him law. In like manner <em>holla</em> was a term used to
a horse (Ven. and Adon., St. 48, As You Like it, iii. 2), to
make him stop, stand quiet, and formed from <em>hold</em> and, perhaps, <em>hard</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
<em>
Span-counter</em> (2 H. VI. iv. 3), a game played by boys with
counters or pieces of money; but it is not well known in
what manner. The span or distance between the thumb and
the little finger when the hand is on the stretch, had of
course something to do with it, as in <em>Three-hole-span</em>, a game
at marbles.</p>

<p><em>Speak</em> (K. John, ii. 1, J. C. iv. 3, Cor. v. 3). Editors do
not seem to have observed that in these and other places
<em>speak</em> is synonymous with <em>say</em>.</p>

<p><em>Split.</em> "Make all split" (M. N. D. i. 2), was a common
phrase, denoting violence of action; but the allusion is not
exactly known. We say "split the sides" with laughter.</p>

<p><em>Spoons</em> (H. VIII. v. 3). It was the custom for the sponsors
at a christening to make a present of spoons, named
Apostle-spoons, because the handle was terminated with
the figure of one of the Apostles. The spoons were usually
of silver. The wealthy gave the entire dozen, others
according to their means.</p>

<p><em>Spy of the time</em> (Macb. iii. 2). This most unusual phrase
occurs only in this place. The meaning of <em>spy</em> in it must
be, exact information. It is very remarkable that Ariosto
uses <em>spia</em> in exactly the same sense:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Non ha avuto Agramante ancora <em>spia</em>,</div>
<div class="i0">Ch' Astolfo mandi una armata si grossa."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Or. Fur. xxxix. 79.</p>

<p>See also vii. 34, viii. 68, ix. 14, xxxvii. 90, I Suppositi, v. 6.
Could Shakespeare have read Ariosto in Italian? <em>Spy</em> does
not occur in Harrington's translation; but Gascoigne renders
<em>ebbero spia</em> in I Suppositi by <em>had espial</em>. In Gower
(Conf. Am. v.) we have</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="i0">In aunter."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><em>Stalking-horse</em> (As Y. L. v. 4), either a real horse trained
for the purpose, or the imitation of one carried by the sportsman
by means of which his was enabled to get within
shooting-distance of wild fowl.</p>

<p><em>Statute</em> (sc. staple, merchant) Ham. v. 1, a legal mode of
securing a debt on the debtor's land. <em>Recognizance</em> in the same
place is an acknowledgment by the debtor for the same purpose;
<em>fines</em> and <em>recoveries</em> were legal modes of cutting off an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
entail; <em>double voucher</em> was connected with a recovery, two
persons being required to <em>vouch</em> for the tenant's title.</p>

<p><em>Stell</em> (Lear, iii. 7). It is very doubtful in what sense this
verb is used here. It is usually supposed to be the same as
<em>stellar</em>; but there is no instance of its use in that sense, while
in Lucrece, st. 207, and in Son. xxiv. we have it in the sense
of <em>place</em>, of which (except these passages of our poet) only the
following instance has been given, and that of the subst., not
the verb. "The said <em>stell</em> of Plessis," Danet, Comines. <em>Stelle</em>
and <em>stel</em> are the German and Dutch, <em>stead</em> the English, for
place.</p>

<p><em>Sticking-place</em> (Macb. i. 7). The best explanation of this
seems to be that which supposes it to be the point to
which the strings of musical instruments are screwed up in
tuning.</p>

<p><em>Stickler</em> (Tr. and Cr. v. 9), one whose office it was, at
single combats or trials of skill, to stand by and see fair play,
and to end the matter when he deemed it right to do so.
He bore a <em>stick</em>, whence the name. Like some other words
it has somewhat changed its meaning, for it now means one
who <em>contends</em> for something.</p>

<p><em>Stint</em> (R. and J. i. 3, Tr. and Cr. iv. 5, Tim. v. 5), cease,
stop, put an end to. "<em>Stint</em> thy babbling tongue" (Jonson,
Cynth. Rev. i. 1). "<em>Stint</em> thy idle chat" (Marston, What
You Will). "<em>Lacrimas supprimere</em>, to <em>stint</em> weeping" (Baret,
Alvearie).</p>

<p><em>Strachy.</em> "The Lady of the Strachy" (Tw. N. ii. 5). What
the allusion is here, and the meaning of <em>Strachy</em> are alike
unknown. Payne Knight conjectured that this word may
be a corruption of <em>Stratico</em>, the title of the Governor of Messina;
but this is very dubious.</p>

<p><em>Stuck</em> (Tw. N. iii. 5, Ham. iv. 7), seems to be a corruption
of <em>stocco</em>, It., a rapier.</p>

<p><em>Sword.</em> Swearing by the sword (W. T. ii. 3, Ham. i. 5),
was in effect swearing by the Cross, as the hilt and blade
were separated by a cross bar of metal.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Take</em> (M. W. iv. 4, Ham. i. 1, Lear, ii. 4), to strike, blast,
infect. Here it is used in a causative sense, with an ellipsis
of the object, as disease, etc.&mdash;<em>Take in</em> (Ant. and Cl. i. 1,
iii. 7, Cymb. iv. 2) is the same as the simple <em>take</em>. It is a
mere translation of the Dutch <em>ennemen</em>, learned in the wars
of the Low Countries.&mdash;<em>Take with</em> (1 H. IV. ii. 4, R. and J.
iii. 5), cause to understand, keep, as it were, in the same pace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
with.&mdash;<em>Take up</em> (All's Well, ii. 3, 2 H. IV. i. 2), sc. money
or things on credit.</p>

<p><em>Tawdry</em> (W. T. iv. 3), a corruption of Saint Audrey (<em>i.e.</em>
Ethelred), the <em>t</em> being, as was so frequently the case, transferred
to the following word. A fair was held, chiefly at
Ely, on St. Audrey's day (Oct. 17), at which toys, etc., were
sold, among these a kind of silken necklaces, much worn by
the country-maidens. We should perhaps say simply, lace;
for Spenser has</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">"And gird your <em>waist</em></div>
<div class="i0">For more fineness, with a <em>tawdry-lace</em>."</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">Shep. Cal. iv. 135.</p>

<p><em>Tawny.</em> This is simply tanned, <em>i.e.</em> of a brown colour like
that of tanned leather. Hence in 1 H. VI., the Bishop's
men are in "tawny coats," <em>i.e.</em> coats of some variety of brown
colour.</p>

<p><em>Tear a cat</em> (M. N. D. i. 2), an expression of ranting violence
of which the origin is merely conjectural.</p>

<p><a id="Tennis"></a><em>Tennis.</em> The figurative expressions in these plays derived
from this game are:&mdash;<em>Bandy</em> (R. and J. ii. 5, Lear, i. 4 <em>et alibi</em>),
to strike and drive the ball with the racket. <em>Hazard</em> (H. V.
i. 2) is, says Steevens, "a place in the tennis-court into
which the ball was sometimes struck." <em>Chace</em> (<em>ib.</em>) is, says
Douce, "that <em>spot</em> where a ball falls, beyond which the
adversary must strike the ball to gain a point or <em>chace</em>. At
long tennis it is the spot where the ball leaves off rolling."
Steevens quotes from Sidney's Arcadia, book iii. "Then
Fortune&mdash;as if she had made chaces enow on the one side of
that bloody tennis-court&mdash;went on to the other side of the
line." Surely, according to this, with which Shakespeare
agrees, a chace was not a <em>spot</em>. The <em>line</em>, it may be observed,
ran along the court at right angles to the wall against
which they played.</p>

<p><em>Tercel</em> (Tr. and Cr. iii. 2), and <em>tassel-gentle</em> (R. and J.
ii. 2), the male of the goss-hawk, <em>tiercelet</em>, Fr., so called, it is
said, from being a <em>third</em> less than the female, or, some say,
as being one of three in a falcon's nest, the other two
being always females. The epithet <em>gentle</em> denoted its docility.</p>

<p><em>Termagant</em> (Ham. iii. 2), an imaginary being, in the old
mysteries and moralities, usually associated with Mahound,
<em>i.e.</em> Mahomet, and of a furious violent character. The word
still remains, but in a somewhat different sense. It comes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
it is said, from <em>Trivagante</em>, It., used in the same manner.
May not the remote origin be <em>Ter</em>-(i.e. <em>Tris</em>-) <em>megistos</em>?</p>

<p><em>Thewes</em> (2 H. IV. iii. 4, Ham. i. 3, J. C. i. 3). In these
places Shakespeare uses this term in a corporeal sense of the
sinews and muscles, and he may have been the first who did
so. It properly denotes the qualities of the mind, from <em>theaw</em>,
A.S., and is akin to <em>Tugend</em> Germ.</p>

<p><em>Thread and thrum</em> (M. N. D. v. i). The <em>thread</em> is the
warp in a web; the <em>thrum</em>, the tufts formed by the ends
of the thread beyond the web. The two taken together
therefore form the whole.</p>

<p><em>Three-farthings</em> (K. John, i. 1), pieces of silver coin of
that value; of course extremely thin and liable to crack.</p>

<p><em>Three-man song</em> (W. T. iv. 3), a song for three voices. By
way of a joke derived from this we have "<em>three-man beetle</em>"
(1 H. IV. i. 2).</p>

<p><em>Three-pile</em> (M. for M. IV. 3, W. T. iv. 2, L. L. L. v. 2), the
finest kind of velvet. The name alludes to something in its
construction. From <em>pilum</em>? <em>Terciopelo</em> is the Spanish for
velvet.</p>

<p><em>Tick-tack</em> (M. for M. i. 3), same as tric-trac, a game similar
to draughts. "This is the plain game of tick-tack, which
is so called from <em>touch and take</em>; for if you touch a man you
must play him, though to your loss" (Comp. Gamester,
p. 113).</p>

<p><em>Tide.</em> "A parted just at turning of the tide" (H. V. ii. 3).
Here the critics tell us of a superstition connecting death
with the tide of the sea. But as it is added "between
twelve and one," I think we may take <em>tide</em> in its original
sense of, time.</p>

<p><em>Tire</em>, in falconry (from <em>tirer</em>, Fr.). The hawk or any other
bird of prey, was said to <em>tire</em> on its food when it dragged or
tore it to pieces. Shakespeare uses the word metaphorically
(Tim. iii. 6, Cymb. iii. 4).</p>

<p><em>To.</em> Like <em>zu</em>, G., <em>te</em>, D., this particle occurs continually in
Shakespeare in the sense of <em>at</em>. "<em>To</em> Milan let me hear from
you by letters" (Two Gent. i. 1) is an instance generally
not understood by the editors. See above, p. 343. It is also
used with an ellipsis of <em>compared</em> in Two Gent. ii. 4, Ham.
iii. 1, and elsewhere.</p>

<p><em>Toad</em> (As Y. L. ii. 1). It was a notion in those times that
the poor innocent toad had in the interior of his head a stone
endued with great virtues, named <em>borax</em> or <em>stelon</em>. See Fenton,
Secret Wonders of Nature, 1569, and other authors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
Perhaps the notion originated in the great brilliancy of the
toad's eye, which may have been termed 'a jewel.'</p>
<div class="center">

<p class="right">Lingua, v. 6.</p>

<p><em>Tokens</em> (L. L. L. v. 2, Ant. and Cl. iii. 8), the spots on
the body denoting the plague. The house in which there
was one or more persons who had them was shut up, and
<em>Lord have mercy upon us!</em> put over the door.</p>

<p><a id="Too"></a><em>Too.</em> This word occurs in the sense of <em>trop</em>, Fr., <em>i.e.</em> excessively,
in Com. of Err. i. 2, L. L. L. ii. 1, Temp. ii. 2,
and other places. For the difference of <em>trop</em> and <em>too</em>, <em>assez</em>
and <em>enough</em>, see what I have written in Notes and Queries,
3 Ser. x. 430.</p>

<p><em>Tray-trip</em> (Tw. N. ii. 5), the name of some game, probably
played with dice; but of which we have no description.</p>

<p><em>Tribulacion.</em> "The Tribulacion of Tower-hill or the Limbs
of Limehouse" (H. VIII. v. 3) are supposed to have been
the names of two Puritan congregations.</p>

<p><em>Triple</em> (All's Well, ii. 1, Ant. and Cl. i. 1), third, one of
three, a sense only to be found in Shakespeare.</p>

<p><em>Troll-my-Dames</em> (W. T. iv. 2), a corruption of the French
<em>Trou-madame</em>, a game also called <em>Pigeon-holes</em>, our present
bagatelle.</p>

<p><em>Trossers</em> (H. V. iii. 7), the tight, close-fitting pantaloons
worn by the native Irish. Hence <em>trowsers</em>.</p>

<p><em>Truckle-bed</em> (M. W. iv. 5, R. and J. ii. 1), a bed on castors
(<em>trochlea</em>) for the use of the servant, who lay in the same
room with the master or mistress. During the day it was
run under the state-bed, and at night was drawn out at the
foot. It was also called <em>trundle-bed</em>.</p>

<p><em>Truepenny</em> (Ham. i. 5). Mr. Collier says he was informed
that in the mining-districts of the Midland counties this
term signifies a particular indication on the soil of the direction
in which ore is to be found.</p>

<p><em>Try with main-course</em> (Temp. i. 1). "To hale the tack
aboord, the sheat close aft, the boling set up, and the helm
tied close aboord" (Smith, Sea Grammar, 1627).</p>

<p><em>Tub</em> (M. for M. iii. 2, H. V. ii. 1, Tim. iv. 3). It was one
of the modes of curing the venereal disease to put the patient
in a heated tub, where he was sweated, being at the same
time fed on mutton roasted dry, etc.</p>

<p><em>Tucket</em> (H. V. iv. 2), the Italian <em>toccata</em>, a blast of the
trumpet for a charge or advance.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
<em>Turk Gregory</em> (1 H. IV. v. 3). In this are united two
objects of the utmost horror and fear, the Grand Turk and
the famous Pope Gregory VII., as depicted by Foxe in his
Book of Martyrs.</p>

<p><em>Turnbull-street</em> (2 H. IV. iii. 2), a street in Clerkenwell,
now restored to its original name of <em>Turnmill-street</em>. It was
the resort of bullies, whores, <em>et id genus omne</em>.</p>

<p><em>Two and thirty a pip out</em> (T. of Sh. i. 2), <em>i. e</em>. thirty-one;
the allusion being, it is said, to a game of cards called <em>Bone-ace</em>
or <em>Thirty-one</em>. A <em>pip</em> is one of the spots on the cards.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Utis</em> (2 H. IV. ii. 4), or <em>Utas</em>, the eighth day after a festival,
or Saint's-day: from <em>huit</em>, Fr. As it was a holiday,
it came to signify sport, festivity, amusement in general.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Veal.</em> "<em>Veal</em>, quoth the Dutchman" (L. L. L. v. 2). In
Dutch <em>Veel</em> is much, many, often. Here it seems to answer
to <em>Much</em>!</p>

<p><em>Veney</em>, <em>venew</em> (M. W. i. 1, L. L. L. v. 1), an assault in
fencing&mdash;from <em>venue</em>, Fr., a coming-on. It was the Italian
<em>stoccata</em>.</p>

<p><em>Vice</em> (Tw. N. iv. 2), same as <em>Iniquity</em>, which see.</p>

<p><em>Vie</em> (T. Sh. ii. 1, Ant. and Cl. v. 2), to bet, lay. The
noun is the French <em>envi</em>, the Spanish <em>envite</em>.</p>

<p><em>Virginal</em> (W. T. i. 2). The virginal was the first form of
the pianoforte. It was rectangular, differing in this from
the spinnet, the harpsichord, and grand piano. Nares, who
had seen the instrument, describes it exactly. It was sometimes
called a <em>pair of virginals</em>, as an organ was a <em>pair of
organs</em>, in allusion probably to the set (pair) of keys.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>Wanton</em> (from <em>wendan</em>, A.S., turn, change?) seems to have
originally signified yielding, changeable. We have "the
wanton green" (M. N. D. ii. 2), "the wanton rushes" (1
H. IV. iii. 1).</p>

<p><em>Water-work</em> (2 H. IV. ii. 1) seems to mean work done on
cloth in water-colours, or distemper.</p>

<p><em>Weaver</em> (Tw. N. ii. 3, 1 H. IV. ii. 4). Weavers, from the
sedentary nature of their work, seem to have been much
addicted to singing, especially psalms. By the <em>three souls</em>
in the first of these passages is meant the <em>vegetative, sensitive</em>,
and <em>reasonable</em> souls, which were held to compose <em>the
soul</em>.</p>

<p><em>Weyard.</em> This is the way in which Shakespeare spells in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
Macbeth the word which in G. Douglas and Holinshed is
spelt <em>weird</em>.</p>

<p><em>Wheel</em> (Ham. iv. 5), the burthen in a ballad, a translation
of <em>rota</em>, probably on account of its coming round and round.</p>

<p><em>Whiffler</em> (H. V. v. Chor.), a fifer, who went first in a
procession. It then came to be used of any one who went
before to clear the way.</p>

<p><a id="While_whiles_whilst"></a><em>While, whiles, whilst.</em> The first of these words is a noun,
signifying time; the second is the adverbial genitive of it,
and the third this last with a paragogic <em>t</em>. <em>While</em> is used
adverbially, like <em>whiles</em>, with an ellipsis of <em>in the</em>. It also
occurs, as in the following passages, with an ellipsis of <em>to
the</em>, <em>till the</em>. "The Romans had a law that every man should
use shooting in peace-time, <em>while</em> he was forty year old"
(Ascham, Toxoph. p. 16). "When the conjured spirit appears,
which will not be <em>while</em> after many circumstances,"
etc. (K. James, Demonol.).</p>

<p>In Lincolnshire <em>while</em> is used at the present day for <em>until</em>.
This is evidently the sense in which <em>whiles</em> is used in Twelfth
Night, iv. 3; for Macb. iii. 1 see the note.</p>

<p><em>Whistling.</em> In falconry the whistle was, for the bird, the
sign of starting and of returning. The term of the former
was <em>whistle off</em> (Oth. iii. 3) against the wind after game,
<em>down</em> the wind if cast off as worthless and untameable. "I
have been worth the whistle" (Lear, iv. 2) seems to refer
to the whistle of recall. "As a long-winged hawk, when
he is first <em>whistled off</em> the fist, mounts aloft, and for his pleasure
fetcheth many a circuit in the air, still soaring higher
and higher, till he come to his full <em>pitch</em>; and in the end,
when the game is sprung, comes down amain, and stoops
upon the sudden" (Burt. Anat. of Mel. ii. 1-3).</p>

<p><em>Who</em> (M. of Ven. ii. 7, <em>et alibi</em>). This pronoun was often
used, as here, of things.
Hence we still use the gen. <em>whose</em>.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
<em>Wild-goose chase</em> (R. and J. ii, 4) was something like our
steeple-chase. There were only two riders; and when one
got the lead, the other was obliged to follow wheresoever
he went.</p>
<p>
<em>Winchester goose</em> (1 H. VI. i. 3, Tr. and Cr. v. 11). This is
said to be a swelling caused by a disease got in the stews.
The latter passage, however, might intimate that it was a
denizen of them. The origin of the phrase is supposed to be
the circumstance of the stews being chiefly on the Bankside,
which was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Winchester;
the proximity of the river may have caused the
use of the term <em>goose</em>.</p>

<p><em>Wish</em> (M. Ado, iii. 1, M. for M. iv. 3, Ant. and Cl. i. 3),
advise, recommend; (T. of Sh. i. 1) to introduce.</p>

<p><em>Wit.</em> This word was the same as <em>esprit</em>, Fr., and meant
mental power, talent. Thus we have <em>wit and humour</em> still
in use, but with changed signification; for it meant talent
and character (individuality), as we have "wit and judgment"
(Oth. iv. 2); or perhaps there may be an ellipsis of
<em>good</em> with <em>humour</em>. The "five wits" (Tw. N. iv. 2) are said
to be the five mental powers, "common wit [sense], imagination,
fantasy, estimation [judgment], and memory"
(Hawes, Bell. Pucel. ch. xxiv. <em>ap.</em> Malone). They were
probably originally the five senses; but Shakespeare (Son.
cxli.) clearly distinguishes them.</p>

<p><em>With</em> (T. Sh. iv. 2, Ant. and Cl. v. 2, <em>et alibi</em>), by, a sense
it still bears, but not as in these places.</p>

<p><em>World.</em> "Go to the world" (All's Well, i. 3), "be a
woman of the world" (As Y. L. v. 3), be married, have, as
it were, a place in the world.</p>

<p><em>Worm</em> (Ant. and Cl. v. 2, <em>et alibi</em>), snake, serpent, <em>wyrm</em>,
A.S. Among Shakespeare's other errors in natural history
seems to be that of his supposing (M. N. D. iii. 2, R. II. iii.
2) the adder to sting with its tongue. See, however, Ham.
iii. 4, 3 H. VI. i. 4. Webster actually says,</p>
